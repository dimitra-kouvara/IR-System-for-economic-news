But average hourly earnings over the past 12 months rose 4.8 per cent, and the unemployment rate dropped to 4.2 per cent.AgenciesFederal Reserve policymakers look likely to accelerate the winddown of their bond-buying program when they meet later this month, despite November job gains that came in short of expectations, as they move to take out insurance in case inflation does not recede next year as expected.\n\n U.S. employers added 210,000 jobs last month, a U.S. Labor Department report showed Friday, less than half of what economists had expected. But average hourly earnings over the past 12 months rose 4.8 per cent, and the unemployment rate dropped to 4.2 per cent.\n\n Shortly after the report was released St. Louis Fed President James Bullard intensified his call for faster action by the Fed's policy-setting panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, and said more of his colleagues had become comfortable with the idea of speeding up the bond-buying taper.\n\n \"The danger now is that we get too much inflation,\" Bullard said. \"It's time for the FOMC to react at upcoming meetings.\"\n\n The Fed has kept interest rates near zero since March 2020. Last month, citing substantial progress in the labor market and higher-than-expected inflation, the Fed began reducing its $120 billion in bond purchases each month on a pace that would end them entirely by June 2022.\n\n But, with inflation running at more than twice the Fed's 2 per cent target and risks rising that it won't recede next year as quickly as policymakers would like, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said this week that at the Fed's next policy meeting on Dec. 14-15 they would consider speeding up the taper by a few months.\n\n \"This doesn't do anything to derail the Fed from a faster taper,\" said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, calling the jobs report \"solid.\"\n\n \"I'm not sure there's anything here that would change their mind.\"\n\n LIFTOFF BEFORE JUNE?\nBullard has for months been on the hawkish end of the Fed's policy spectrum, but in the last few weeks more of his colleagues have joined him in wanting at least the option of raising rates earlier than June.\n\n Fed policymakers generally agree that a liftoff from near-zero rates should only start after the Fed has stopped buying bonds.\n\n Friday's labor report showed the largest increase in labor force participation in 13 months, and women entering the labor force at the fastest rate since March.\n\n \"We think the Fed will view the economy as near full employment,\" Barclays economists wrote in a note, adding that not only do they expect the central bank to speed up its taper in December, but also to begin raising rates in March.\n\n Economists at Goldman Sachs noted following the report that the survey response rate that feeds into the payrolls number was the lowest for a November in 13 years. Several months this year have seen upward revisions in later readings, owing in part to the difficulty of data collection during the pandemic.\n\n Bullard echoed that in comments to reporters, adding he expecting upward revisions to the payrolls number.\n\n Interest-rate futures traders are pricing in a rate increase in May, with two more by the end of 2022. That's more than the two rate increases Bullard said he has penciled in, though he said if inflation doesn't fall as he expects, he would want the option to do more.\n\nPick the best companies to investBECOME AN ETPRIME MEMBERRead More News onFedFed TaperFederal ReserveUS Job dataUS Fed(What's moving Sensex and  Nifty  Track  latest market news,  stock tips and  expert advice on  ETMarkets.

        "Article": "SynopsisSpeaking at the inauguration of an ESG Centre for Research and Innovation at IIM Ahmedabad, Tyagi stressed on the need of in depth research on ESG norms with focus towards developing high quality, objective, content-specific rating matrices.AgenciesNew Delhi: Markets regulator Sebi is in the process of putting in place disclosure for mutual fund schemes with the ESG (environment sustainability and governance) theme, its chief Ajay Tyagi said on Friday. Also, the regulator is examining the disclosure of ESG related aspects in the rating press release by credit rating agencies, he added. \n\n Speaking at the inauguration of an ESG Centre for Research and Innovation at IIM Ahmedabad, Tyagi stressed on the need of in depth research on ESG norms with focus towards developing high quality, objective, content-specific rating matrices. \n\n \"Research in ESG can go a long way towards converting intangible and amorphous variables of business to measurable and quantifiable returns, both financial and social,\" he said. \n\n The Sebi chief noted that Indian investors are showing increased interest in ESG compliant companies and investment products. Also, ESG funds are rapidly expanding in the Indian mutual fund industry. \n\n Asset management companies (AMCs) have been launching equity schemes in the ESG space under thematic category. The AMCs are also launching exchange traded funds (ETFs) and ETF fund of funds in ESG space. \n\n As on October 31, 2021, there were 11 mutual fund schemes in India having ESG as their theme with assets under management of over Rs 13,000 crore. \n\n Tyagi said that these schemes have disclosures in their scheme information documents (SIDs) in line with the other scheme categories, such as investment objective, asset allocation, investment strategy, investment restrictions, and subsequent disclosures. \n\n \"However, these disclosures often do not bring out clearly all aspects related to ESG investing including investment strategy, usage of proprietary / third-party scoring in investment decision-making and monitoring of ESG investments. Sebi is in the process of stipulating disclosures specific to ESG schemes,\" he added. \n\n Sebi came out with the consultation paper for introducing disclosure norms for ESG MF schemes in October, whereby it proposed various disclosures in the SID that will ensure that the type of strategy followed by the scheme, with regards to sustainability or ESG characteristics merit the nomenclature of an ESG fund. \n\n The proposal requires schemes to only invest in securities that have business responsibility and sustainability report (BRSR) disclosures or equivalent in case of overseas securities. Link to BRSR disclosure or equivalent should be provided for each security. \n\n Though the mandated allocation for securities with ESG theme is at least 80 per cent and the disclosure norms apply to these securities only, the regulator has proposed not too much deviation from the scheme philosophy for the remaining 20 per cent allocation. \n\n According to Tyagi, the introduction of BRSR and launch of ESG mutual fund schemes have generated interest in ESG ratings as a way for ESG disclosures by listed issuers to aid investors meaningfully integrate ESG into their investment decisions. \n\n \"In this backdrop, Sebi is examining the disclosure of ESG related aspects in the rating press release by credit rating agencies,\" he added. \n\n He, further, said that ESG ratings have become equally important for unlisted companies. \n\n Considering the diversity in business models, ecological implications, cultural nuances which have implications for companies' dealings with employees, customers and channel partners, among others, the landscape for research in ESG is vast and extensive, Tyagi said. \n\n Research should focus on identifying factors or constituents of measuring ESG which are specific to the company's region, country and industry, their calculation and relative weights in the overall ESG framework, he added. \n\n \"In line with global trends, Sebi is looking at what could be the regulatory and supervisory approaches for ESG rating provider,\" the chairman said. \n\n The international forum for securities regulators International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) has recently published its report on 'ESG Ratings and ESG Data Providers', wherein it called for oversight of such rating providers. \n\n The report recommended greater attention by regulators on the use of ESG ratings and activities of ESG rating providers in their jurisdictions. This could help to increase trust in ESG ratings going forward.\nPick the best companies to investBECOME AN ETPRIME MEMBERRead More News onAjay TyagiESGSebienvironment sustainability and governanceESG scheme(What's moving Sensex and  Nifty  Track  latest market news,  stock tips and  expert advice on  ETMarkets.

This he said was possible as, \u201cyoungsters came up with ideas, the way government & private sector both coordinated, funding happened and our robust academic institutions played their part.\"\n\nVaishnaw added that India had a very good demographic advantage, good academic institutions and the government was supporting this growth in a \u201csolid, consistent way\u201d and that was feeding into this public private win-win structure.\n\nKant asked the panel to elaborate examples of using fintech beyond finance, to which Vaishnaw said IRCTC was a prime example. \u201cWhen it started booking online tickets, it was 20 tickets a day, today it is 1.5 million reservations a day and beyond reservations, a lot more stuff is going on in IRCTC,\u201d Vaishnaw said.

Omicron was detected over a week ago in the country's most populous province, Gauteng, and has since spread to all eight other provinces, Health Minister Joe Phaahla said.COVID-19 CASESWorldIndiaConfirmed33,531,498Deaths445,768Confirmed229,508,037Deaths4,707,821Dr. Sikhulile Moyo was analyzing COVID-19 samples in his lab in Botswana last week when he noticed they looked startlingly different from others. \n\n Within days, the world was ablaze with the news that the coronavirus had a new variant of concern - one that appears to be driving a dramatic surge in South Africa and offering a glimpse of where the pandemic might be headed.\n\n New COVID-19 cases in South Africa have burgeoned from about 200 a day in mid-November to more than 16,000 on Friday. Omicron was detected over a week ago in the country's most populous province, Gauteng, and has since spread to all eight other provinces, Health Minister Joe Phaahla said.\n\n Even with the rapid increase, infections are still below the 25,000 new daily cases that South Africa reported in the previous surge, in June and July.\n\n Little is known about the new variant, but the spike in South Africa suggests it might be more contagious, said Moyo, the scientist who may have been the first to identify the new variant, though researchers in neighboring South Africa were close on his heels. Omicron has more than 50 mutations, and scientists have called it a big jump in the evolution of the virus.\n\n It's not clear if the variant causes more serious illness or can evade the protection of vaccines. Phaahla noted that only a small number of people who have been vaccinated have gotten sick, mostly with mild cases, while the vast majority of those who have been hospitalized were not vaccinated.\n\n But in a worrisome development, South African scientists reported that omicron appears more likely than earlier variants to cause reinfections among people who have already had a bout with COVID-19.\n\n \"Previous infection used to protect against delta, and now with omicron it doesn't seem to be the case,\" one of the researchers, Anne von Gottberg of the University of Witwatersrand, said at a World Health Organization briefing on Thursday.\n\n While the study did not examine the protection offered by vaccination, von Gottberg said: \"We believe that vaccines will still, however, protect against severe disease.\"\n\n The findings, posted online Thursday, are preliminary and haven't yet undergone scientific review.\n\n South Africa's hospitals are so far coping with the surge, even those in Gauteng province, which accounts for more than 70% of all new infections, Phaahla said.\n\n The picture could change because most of those infected thus far have been younger people, who generally do not get as sick as older patients. But Moyo expressed hope that vaccines would continue to work against the variant.\n\n \"I have a lot of hope from the data that we see that those vaccinated should be able to have a lot of protection,\" he said.\n\n That dovetails with what officials from WHO in Asia said Friday. \n\n While warning that cases could well rise quickly because of omicron, Dr. Takeshi Kasai, WHO regional director for the Western Pacific, said the measures used against the delta variant - which itself caused surges the world over - should remain at the core of the response.\n\n \"The positive news in all of this is that none of the information we have currently about omicron suggests we need to change the directions of our response,\" Kasai said.\n\n That means continuing to push for higher vaccination rates, abiding by social-distancing guidelines, and wearing masks, among other measures, said WHO Regional Emergency Director Dr. Babatunde Olowokure. \n\n While more than three dozen countries worldwide have reported omicron infections, the numbers so far are small outside of South Africa. That has led many countries to race to impose travel restrictions on visitors from southern Africa - a move WHO officials said may buy some time, though the agency previously urged against the closing of borders.\n\n The travel restrictions have been severely criticized by South Africa, which says it is being punished for being transparent and moving so quickly to alert the world to omicron. WHO said it was notified by the country on Nov. 24 about the new variant. \n\n \"What we must reemphasize is that while our scientists and those in Botswana were the first discover and report on the variant, no one knows where it originated,\" Phaahla said.\n\nRead More News onomicronsouth africaafricacoronavirusevolutionvirussvientistsdeltainfections(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

Their objections were broadly on the same grounds.\n\nAlmost all these members alleged motive behind the government taking the ordinance route to bring the law just before the commencement of a Parliament session.\n\nThey said it was a plot to extend the tenure of ED director Sanjay Kumar Mishra whose tenure was to end last month. By having say on their tenure, the government is trying to keep the agencies' chiefs under tighter executive control, they alleged, adding it violated the SC order that fixed two-year tenures for these posts.\n\nRejecting the charges, minister Jitendra Singh argued that the earlier laws emphasised the minimum tenures of CBI and ED chiefs and were not about their maximum term. \"If you read the CVC Act, it clearly says the director of enforcement will hold office for 'not less than two years.

HAI has made recommendations to Arava Gopi Krishna, Delhi excise commissioner and Manish Sisodia, deputy chief minister of Delhi to address challenges faced by the industry as a result of flaws in the new excise policy. \n\nCalling for the immediate deferment in the rollout of the new excise policy, MP Bezbaruah, secretary general, HAI said: \u201cSeveral clauses in the new excise policy go against the very basis of ease of doing business by hotels. For instance, one of the clauses in the new excise policy makes hotels liable for acts of a third party by making them responsible and penalizing them for any misrepresentation of facts by the customer. This will have an adverse impact on hotels\u2019 liquor sales and create operational difficulties for hotels,\" he said. \n\n\"Similarly, there is a differing view on the timings for service of liquor. While license conditions permit service throughout the day, permissions differ under the licensing conditions applicable as per permissions of the Delhi Police. The policy lacks clarity and needs to be reviewed before being implemented fully. \n\nEngagement with relevant industry players before implementing the policy will go a long way in creating a mutually beneficial framework in Delhi NCR,\" he added. Presently, Delhi Police permissions under the DCP Licensing conditions allow restaurants to remain open till 1 am only. HAI said in its letter to the Delhi excise commissioner and the state government, it has highlighted that in the absence of a \u2018specific\u2019 license, hotels are unable to serve, or own liquor stored in L-15/L-16 licensed premises in banquets.

The Kerala-based lender sold the loan after the road asset\u2019s owner, IL&FS Transportation Network Ltd (ITNL), failed to close a deal it signed almost a year ago with I Square Capital-backed Cube Highway to sell CNTL. Federal Bank recovered nearly 75 paise on a rupee by selling its Rs 212.63 crore loan to Assets Care & Enterprise Ltd, the people said. The transaction closed early this week, one of them said.\n\nCube Highways had offered Rs 3,900 crore, implying a recovery of nearly 82% for lenders. But the long stop date of the agreement lapsed on August 30 this year, which prompted the private bank to consider an out-of-court resolution.

This follows the top court's 24-hour ultimatum to the central government to take \"real action\" on curbing air pollution. \n\nA special bench led by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana had told the government that the court would set up its own \"task force\" to deal with the problem if the government failed to do so.\n\nSolicitor General Tushar Mehta informed the bench on Friday that the government has set up an emergency task force and several 'flying squads' to crack down on polluting units in the region. The five-member task force will have preventive and punitive powers.\n\nOf late, the central government and governments of Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Haryana have taken steps to curb air pollution but they haven't made a substantial difference.\n\nThe central government, on the recommendation of the air quality management commission, enforced work-from-home (WFH) for all government employees, except those in essential services.\n\nEssential services workers have been encouraged to pool vehicles to check vehicular pollution while the private sector has been urged to encourage WFH.\n\nBesides, the government has banned all construction activities, except projects of national importance such as highways, railways and metro.\n\nIndustrial units have been asked to shift to cleaner fuels and thermal plants have been shut. Those not using clean fuels have been asked to restrict their work to eight hours and stay shut on weekends.\n\nThe UP government, through senior advocate Ranjit Kumar, objected to the restricting of work hours for industries. It would affect industries in Uttar Pradesh, he said. At one point, he said the winds which bring smog to Delhi-NCR were not coming from UP but from Pakistan, prompting the CJI to ask if he wanted the court to shut down industries there. \n\nThe commission has also banned non-essential vehicles from entering Delhi, for the time being.\n\nAll these will have to be implemented. The central government's new task force and its 'flying squads' will implement these decisions.

It also enhances water security.\n\nAs per 2019 figures, India has 5,745 large dams, nearly 300 of them more than 100 years old, and at least another 1,000 such structures of 50-100 years' vintage. Hence the pressing need for mechanism design for their structural rehabilitation and operational safety. It is true that 18 states and five dam-owning bodies have their own Dam Safety Organisation (DSO), but in the absence of a central law, dam safety norms have tended to vary from state to state. Water is in the State List as per the Constitution, but Entry 56 in the Union List does enable the Centre to bring forth legislation for regulation of inter-state river waters and river valleys.\n\nThe Dam Safety Act calls for oversight of 'surveillance, inspection, operations and maintenance' of all large dams. A national committee on dam safety is to be set up, together with a National Dam Safety Authority. Further, each state is to form its committee on dam safety, along with a state dam safety organisation. We need modern information technology tools for 24x7 surveillance of large dams, by installing sensors and by purposefully leveraging our satellite communications infrastructure.\n\nIn tandem, we need to have in place an advanced forecasting network to better manage sluice gates. Global warming and rising variability in rainfall call for heightened capacity for storage reservoirs, focused watershed management and regular maintenance.\n\nRead More News ondam safety organisationindiadam safety actconstitutionETPrime stories of the dayAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

Videos circulating on social media showed the mob dragging his heavily bruised body outside, where they burned it, surrounded by hundreds of others who cheered on the killers.AFPPakistan's government has long been under pressure to change the country's blasphemy laws, something the Islamists strongly resist.A Muslim mob descended on a sports equipment factory in Pakistan's eastern Punjab province on Friday, killing a Sri Lankan man and burning his body publicly over allegations of blasphemy, police said.\n\n Armagan Gondal, a police chief in the district of Sialkot, where the killing occurred, said factory workers had accused the victim of desecrating posters bearing the name of Islam's Prophet Muhammad. \n\n Police said initial information shows the Sri Lankan, later identified as Priyantha Kumara, a manager at the facility, was lynched inside the factory. Videos circulating on social media showed the mob dragging his heavily bruised body outside, where they burned it, surrounded by hundreds of others who cheered on the killers.\n\n Senior police officer Omar Saeed Malik said police were still trying to determine what exactly prompted the mob to attack Kumara, whose body was sent to hospital for an autopsy. A thorough investigation was underway, he said.\n\n In Colombo, Foreign Ministry spokesman Sugeeswara Gunaratne said their embassy in Islamabad was verifying details of the incident with Pakistani authorities. \n\n \"Sri Lanka expects that the Pakistan authorities will take required action to investigate and ensure justice,\" he said.\n\n Hours after the attack, Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Twitter that the \"horrific vigilante attack on factory & the burning alive of Sri Lankan manager is a day of shame for Pakistan.\" He promised a thorough investigation and said those responsible will be severely punished according to the law.\n\n In a statement, Pakistan's army chief Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa denounced the killing, saying the \"cold-blooded murder\" by a mob in Sialkot was \"extremely condemnable and shameful.\"\n\n \"Such extra-judicial vigilantism cannot be condoned at any cost,\" Bajwa added. \n\n According to police, more than 100 suspects were arrested over involvement in the attack, widely condemned by many Pakistanis.\n\n In the videos, some in the mob are heard chanting a popular slogan of a radical Islamist party, Tehreek-e-Labiak Pakistan, which last month held a violent rally over the publications of caricatures of Islam's prophet in France. The party gained prominence in Pakistan's 2018 elections, campaigning on the single issue of defending the blasphemy law.\n\n Mob attacks on people accused of blasphemy are common in this Islamic nation, although such attacks on foreign nationals are rare. Charges of blasphemy carry the death penalty under Pakistani law. International and Pakistani rights groups say accusations of blasphemy have often been used to intimidate religious minorities and settle personal scores.\n\n Punjab's chief minister Usman Buzdar tweeted that he ordered a probe into the attack. Khan's special adviser on religious affairs, Tahir Ashrafi, condemned the killing and promised stern punishment for those involved. \n\n Friday's attack comes less than a week after a Muslim mob burned a police station and four police posts in northwestern Pakistan, after officers refused to hand over a mentally unstable man accused of desecrating Islam's holy book, the Quran. No officers were hurt in the attacks in Charsadda, a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. \n\n Pakistan's government has long been under pressure to change the country's blasphemy laws, something the Islamists strongly resist.\n\n A Punjab governor was shot and killed by his own guard in 2011, after he defended a Christian woman, Aasia Bibi, who was accused of blasphemy. She was acquitted after spending eight years on death row and, following threats, left Pakistan for Canada to join her family.\n\nRead More News onpakistanBlasphemysri lankapakistan policeOmar Saeed Malik(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

ET BureauVital parts of helping farmers in ways other than through government handouts, whether as procurement of superfluous output, assorted subsidies or income-support payments, comprise increasing their productivity, enhancing their market linkages and helping them capture a larger share of the value that gets added to farm produce along its journey from the farm gate to the retail consumer. By increasing productivity, people understand better seeds, improved use of irrigation and fertiliser, better transplanting and minimising post-harvest waste. The neglected bit is pest control. That must change.\n\nThere is a tendency to see man-made fertilisers and chemical pesticides as public enemies. People want organic products and politicians pay lip service to organic farming. Sri Lanka's recent food crisis testifies to the impracticality of organic farming except as a niche segment. The point is to use fertilisers and pesticides intelligently. Fertiliser subsidies encourage overuse. Irrational use of pesticides and pesticide bans on the ground that they are banned in Europe or elsewhere lead to loss, compounded by pesticide resistance. A case in point is chilli farmers in Andhra Pradesh currently being deprived of their traditional organophosphorous pesticides to fight off an infestation of thrips. Now, regulation of insecticides cannot be done to please the pesticide industry. If that had been done, none of the new class of insecticides that disintegrate fairly fast with minimal residue on the plants sprayed would have been developed. At the same time, the harm to consumers must be assessed based on experience and studies in India's climatic conditions, not Europe's or North America's. Farmers must have a say in phasing out pesticides, so that substitutes are identified, and not just assumed to exist.\n\nPesticide efficacy and harm depend on use that factors in the pesticides' modes of action and their deployment in the right sequence, duration and combination. Educating farmers on this is tough, but bans are a cop-out, albeit crowd-pleasing ones.\n\nRead More News onindiaandhra pradeshsri lankapesticide policypesticidefarmersETPrime stories of the dayAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

Speaking at the HT Leadership Summit 2021, Pichai said the tech giant remains committed to playing a strong enabling role in supporting growth of the Indian market through various efforts across cloud, AI and Android. \n\n \"As tech has scaled up and is touching people's lives in a deeper way, it's natural that there needs to be rules of the road. And I think it's a natural part of the process, it makes sense to me that countries think about the concerns of its own citizens and want regulations to make sure it works well for their people,\" Pichai said. \n\n He added that it's important to also understand that free and open internet has helped connect the world and create opportunities. \n\n \"...that's the balance with which we need to engage and work through, where we can find regulations, which help support the open exchange of ideas. The way the internet works today is obviously ideal, but it makes sense that democratic countries are thinking through what makes sense for the country,\" he noted. \n\n He stated that balance is important and as a large company, Google deals with many regulatory systems in different countries. \n\n \"I view it as an important role for Google to be local, and engage in every country with the best interest of the country too...we are deeply committed to engaging in every country locally, complying with local laws,\" Pichai said. \nSTARTUP ROCKSTARS IN 2021Sign-in to see our list of the most promising startups of 2021SIGN INThank You!\n    \t\t            For being a subscriber of ETtech Top 5 newsletter.\n    \t\t            \nHere is your chance to spread the word & win exclusive rewards!\n    \t\t        Unlock Rewards\n Asked about opportunities in India, the top executive said it's heartening to see the number of startups proving themselves on a global stage and unicorns getting created. \n\n \"It's an exciting time in India.

ETCIOIBM Chairman and CEO Arvind KrishnaIndia has a primary role to play in advancing the future of quantum computing with a strong scientific and engineering culture, as well as the spirit of innovation, said Arvind Krishna, chairman & CEO, IBM. \u201cIndia has the right attributes play a leadership role,\u201d said Krishna, speaking at the Infinity Forum organised by the International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA) and GIFT City. \n\nQuantum computing will be the next great leap in technology, with the ability to solve problems beyond the reach of today\u2019s computers. \u201cTogether with hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence, quantum computing is a foundational technology that the world needs to make sense of the physical world around us,\u201d said Krishna.\n\n While quantum computing will find application across areas like drug discovery, agriculture and climate models among others, Krishna said that the earliest impact one was likely to see was in finance. \u201cThe possibilities it opens up in finance will be far reaching consequences,\u201d said Krishna, adding that this would happen in the next five years. \n\nPeople and organisations need to start learning quantum skills now as this will prove to be a competitive advantage once quantum computing becomes reality. \n\nPointing out that the finance industry has always been an early adopter of technologies, from mainframes to cloud computing, Krishna said that most financial calculations are really optimization problems. And complex optimization is what quantum computers are good at. McKinsey has identified the 100 most prominent use cases for quantum computing, and of this, 28 of them were in finance. \u201cSome of the world's toughest optimization problems in finance, would require a colossal amount of computation power. And asking classical computers to sequentially compute or billions of combinations is far from ideal. It's too much time and too much money. So even for some of today's fastest supercomputers, running these combinations, is not feasible,\u201d said Krishna. \n\nIBM is running experiments through the IBM Quantum Experience with over 170 partners and has over 20 of these computers accessible to people through the cloud. Last month, the company revealed the first commercial quantum computer that broke the 100-qubit barrier. Qubit measures the power of a quantum computer. It will make a 127-qubit quantum processer available to certain network members and gradually, more widely available. \nSTARTUP ROCKSTARS IN 2021Sign-in to see our list of the most promising startups of 2021SIGN INThank You!\n    \t\t            For being a subscriber of ETtech Top 5 newsletter.\n    \t\t            \nHere is your chance to spread the word & win exclusive rewards!\n    \t\t        Unlock Rewards\nThe company has said that it intends to build a 1000 qubit quantum computer by 2023. \n\n\nRead More News onquantum computingindiaarvind krishnaGIFTIFSCAStay on top of technology and startup news that matters.

Human capital is really the essence for breaking through competitive realms in multiple sectors and that should be our principal focus,\u201d he said. \n\nIndia has national programme called Quantum-Enabled Science and Technology (QuEST), where researchers from institutions such as the Indian Institute of Science (IISC), Indian Space Research Organisation and Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, are working on quantum computing and allied areas, including quantum safe cryptography and quantum communication. In March 2021, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) demonstrated free space quantum communication over a distance of 300 metres- the first of its kind. It was hailed as a precursor to the usage of satellites for transmitting highly encrypted and strategic data.\n\nAbhishek Singh, CEO of Digital India Corporation and MyGov also added that expanding the high-end computing infrastructure to fintech startups can help them build better credit products at earlier stages using technology like quantum computing. He added that the C-DAC network has already extended such technology to developers through Param Shavak and Param Siddhi offerings. But more is needed.\n\n\u201cThere is one way to invest in the quantum computing ecosystem through investments in hackathons and better finding of startups. India has produced a lot of unicorns.

These laws allow particles called quantum bits or qubits\u2014typically photons of light for transmitting data along optical cables\u2014to represent multiple combinations of 1 and 0 simultaneously. When anyone tries to intercept such quantum data in transit, the qubits change their state.

Regardless of change in severity, increase in cases alone may pose overwhelming demand on health care systems and may lead to increased morbidity and mortality, she said. \n\n The Regional Director said as part of enhanced surveillance, countries need to ensure they have early warning systems in place composed of multiple indicators such as rapid increase in cases and test positivity rates. \n\n It is also important to monitor indicators related to disease severity and pressure on health care systems such as bed occupancy in wards and intensive care units, Singh stressed. \n\n She called for enhancing event-based surveillance such as rapid spread of outbreaks in healthcare facilities or communities which may be triggered by a variant that spreads more easily from person to person, or increase in cases among populations expected to have a high level of immunity with prior infections or high vaccination coverage, which may indicate the presence of a variant able to evade the immune response. \n\n Even as studies are ongoing to understand effectiveness of vaccines and therapeutics in view of the multiple mutations in Omicron, it is reasonable to assume that currently available vaccines offer protection against severe disease and death, she said, adding that efforts should be intensified to accelerate COVID-19 vaccination coverage in all eligible populations but with priority for populations at high risk for serious disease who remain unvaccinated or not yet fully vaccinated. \n\n These include older adults, health care workers and those with underlying conditions which puts them at risk of severe disease and death. \n\n National authorities should apply a multi-layered risk mitigation approach to potentially delay export or import of the new variant. Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread, instead they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. \n\n In addition, such bans can adversely impact global health efforts during a pandemic by disincentivising countries to report and share epidemiological and sequencing data, she said. \n\n Countries should be ready to escalate public health and social measures in a timely manner to avoid overwhelming demands on health care services. \n\n On the option of imposing lockdown to curtail virus transmission, the Regional Director said, though effective, these measures are very costly and should be used as a last resort. \n\n \"We cannot and should not let the virus and its variants spread and mutate further and continue to challenge us. We need to do everything we can to curtail their spread. We know what to do. The pandemic has lasted just too long and is draining our precious human and other resources. We need to stop this,\" the Regional Director said.\nRead More News onomicronWHOsouth east asiaworld health organisationvirusreinfectionmorbiditymortalityregional director(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

He said 85 per cent of the beneficiaries have received the first dose, while 50 per cent have been fully vaccinated. \n\n He dared Lok Sabha members to ensure 100 per cent vaccination in their respective constituencies to speed up the inoculation drive. \n\n \"Twenty-two crore vaccine doses are already available with the states and the Centre will make available an additional 10 crore this month,\" Mandaviya said, and added that the government had started 'Har Ghar Dastak' (knock on every door) campaign to speed up vaccination. \n\n Mandaviya said the Modi government had embarked on strengthening the health infrastructure across the country without blaming previous governments who had ignored the sector. \n\n \"Government worked for results. In last two years, decisions under leadership of Prime Minister Modi show that this government works not with power, but with will power,\" the minister said.\nRead More News oncovidcovid vaccineomicronmansukh mandaviyamodi government(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

The study also found that the spread of Beta or Delta variants was due to increased transmissibility, rather than immune escape.\n\n\"We find evidence of a substantial and ongoing increase in the risk of reinfection that is temporally consistent with the timing of the emergence of the Omicron variant in South Africa, suggesting that its selection advantage is at least partially driven by an increased ability to infect previously infected individuals,\" the authors of the study noted.\n\nThe authors said that they found no evidence that reinfection risk increased as a result of the emergence of Beta or Delta variants, suggesting that the selective advantage that allowed these variants to spread derived primarily from increased transmissibility, rather than immune escape.\n\n\"Immune escape from prior infection, whether or not Omicron can also evade vaccine derived immunity, has important implications for public health globally,\" the study said.\n\nThe study found that the risk of reinfection is 25%-30% lower compared to primary infection during the three waves. In contrast, the recent spread of the Omicron variant has been associated with a decrease in the primary infection and an increase in reinfection. The estimated hazard ratio for reinfection versus primary infection for the period from 1 November 2021 to 27 November 2021 versus wave 1 was more than twice. For every one primary infection, the reinfection rate was more than double.\n\nThe researchers have done retrospective analysis of routine epidemiological surveillance data collected through South Africa's National Notifiable Medical Conditions Surveillance System between March 4 2020 to November 27, 2021. The researchers poured through records of 27,96,982 individuals with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 who had a positive test result at least 90 days prior to November 27, 2021. The findings were published in the non-peer reviewed preprint server medRxiv.\n\nThe study's first author Juliet Pulliam, PhD, who directs of the South African Centre for Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis at Stellenbosch University, tweeted that they couldn't make any assessment of whether Omicron also evades vaccine-derived immunity as they didn't have information about the vaccination status of individuals in the data set.\n\nThe researchers said the next priority is to quantify the extent of Omicron\u2019s immune escape for both natural and vaccine-derived immunity, as well as its transmissibility relative to other variants.\n\nOn severity of Omicron, Pulliam said they urgently needed more data on disease severity associated with Omicron infection, including in individuals with a history of prior infection.\nRead More News onomicronstellenbosch universityCoronavirusSouth AfricaDelta Variant(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

Under the system, a taxpayer or an assessee is not required to visit the department\u2019s office or meet a department official for income tax-related disputes.\n\nThe federation, as well as various bar associations of ITAT, in their representation to the ministries of finance and law, said the existing open court system where both the sides of the litigation, the tax-payers and the department, produce their arguments and counter-arguments, is the highest and the last fact-finding authority under the Income-tax Act, 1961, dealing with varied matters involving complicated issues of facts, law, international taxation, transfer pricing.\n\nRead More News onfaceless appeal schemesupreme courtCBDTgovernmentCentral Board of Direct Taxes(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

In a written reply in the Rajya Sabha, Minister of State for Food and Consumer Affairs Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti said the India's ranking is 101st in the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2021 brought out by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe. \n\n Nepal and Bangladesh are ranked 76 and Pakistan is at the 92nd place, she said. \n\n As per the GHI report, the composite GHI scores of India have improved from 38.8 in 2000 to 27.5 in 2021. Thus, the country has shown consistent improvement over the years. \n\n \"The calculation of GHI is based on four indicators - Undernourishment, Child Stunting, Child Wasting and Child Mortality. Global Hunger Index (GHI) does not reflect India's true picture as it is a flawed measure of 'Hunger',\" Jyoti said. \n\n Only one indicator, which is undernourishment, is directly related to hunger, she added. \n\n \"The two indicators i.e. stunting and wasting are outcomes of complex interactions of various other factors like sanitation, genetics, environment. and utilisation of food intake apart from hunger which is taken as the causative/outcome factor for stunting and wasting in the GHI. \n\n \"Also, there is hardly any evidence that the fourth indicator i.e. child mortality is an outcome of hunger,\" the minister said. \n\n Sadhvi highlighted that the government has enacted the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013 which provides for coverage of up to 75 per cent of the rural population and up to 50 per cent of the urban population, thus addressing the hunger alleviation of the bottom 67 per cent of the population, which at Census 2011 is at a maximum of 81.35 crore persons. \n\n Identification of beneficiaries under the Act is under two categories -- households covered under Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) and Priority Households. \n\n The Priority Households are entitled to receive 5 kg foodgrains per person per month and AAY households are entitled to receive 35 kg per household per month at Rs 1-3 per kg for coarse grains/wheat/rice respectively. \n\n \"The Act is operational in a seamless manner across all States and Union Territories. The coverage under the Act is substantially high to ensure that all the vulnerable and needy sections of the society get its benefit,\" she said. \n\n The Centre has also issued advisories to all states to identify and cover the weakest sections of the society under TPDS (Targeted Public Distribution System) and launch special drives to issue ration cards to them up to the respective NFSA coverage limits, the minister added. \n\n Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY), scheme under which beneficiaries covered under NFSA are given additional 5 kg of foodgrains per person per month free of cost, has been extended for another four months, that is from December 2021 to March 2022, she highlighted.\nRead More News onindiaGlobal hunger Indexpriority householdsnfsanational food security act(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

But lawmakers have yet to address the fact that they have authorized more borrowing and spending than their debt limit allows.\n\n \"Congress would be flirting with financial disaster if it leaves for the holiday recess without addressing the debt limit,\" said Shai Akabas, the Washington-based Bipartisan Policy Center's director of economic policy.\n\n If upcoming tax receipts are favorable, the center projected, the debt ceiling could become binding as late as Jan. 28.\n\n On Tuesday, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the Treasury Department could start missing payments by the end of the month, while Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Washington can likely keep paying all its bills through at least Dec. 15.\n\n Once the Treasury Department hits its borrowing limit, it will only have incoming tax receipts to pay its bills. And because it borrows nearly 40 cents for every dollar it spends, the Treasury would start missing payments owed to lenders, citizens or both.\n\n Shock waves would ripple through global financial markets. Domestic spending cuts would push the U.S. economy into recession as the government misses payments on everything from Social Security benefits for the elderly to soldiers' salaries.\n\n Biden's Democrats hold razor-thin majorities in both houses of Congress, but Republicans have vowed not to cooperate on the debt ceiling, which could stymie attempts to lift borrowing limits under normal legislative rules.\n\n With time running out, Democrats could raise the limit without Republican votes under a more time-consuming legislative process known as \"reconciliation.\"\n\nRead More News ontreasury departmentU.S. governmentUS CongressBipartisan Policy CenterJoe BidenDemocratic Party(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

Let's not lose sight of this.\"\n\n The spokesman urged people to use proven measures protect themselves against Delta -- and thereby against Omicron.\n\n The WHO has said it will take several weeks to get a full picture of the transmissibility and disease severity of Omicron, and to assess how vaccines, tests and treatments hold up against the new variant.\n\n As Omicron spreads, pieces of information are emerging from various countries.\n\n \"What we need to do is we need to take all these observations, assessments and tests and get this information together and then have the experts look at it, carefully weigh it and come up with the assessment.

Some commenters responded with threats of violence.\n\nAfter Gateway Pundit posted a June story on Facebook that included debunked claims of voter fraud in Arizona, a commenter said the governor and secretary of state should be \u201cfed feet first through a woodchipper.\u201d A story featuring false claims of vote-rigging in Fulton County, Georgia, drew comments on Facebook calling for an election worker to be hanged or \u201cshot for treason.\u201d\n\nFor years, Facebook has imposed sanctions on Gateway Pundit\u2019s account to limit the spread of its misinformation. But Gateway Pundit still uses its Facebook page to amplify its reporting and raise money: The page features a prominent appeal asking readers to buy subscriptions to support its \u201cbattle for survival.\u201d\n\nGateway Pundit\u2019s continuing presence on Facebook illustrates the platform\u2019s worldwide struggle to stop the spread of disinformation and to balance content-policing with free-speech concerns. Facebook has taken a barrage of criticism this year from critics and a company whistleblower who say its practices stoke anger and division to increase user engagement.\n\nIn a statement to Reuters, Facebook said it seeks to label misinformation and \u201creduce its spread,\u201d using fact checkers and artificial intelligence to identify false or misleading material and warning readers who try to share it. Facebook said repeat offenders, such as the Gateway Pundit, are subject to tougher sanctions, including having their posts pushed to the bottom of users\u2019 news feeds (the lists of posts they see), and being barred from Facebook\u2019s content-promotion services.\n\nBut Facebook almost never removes the offending posts or shuts down the pages \u2013 that happens only in rare circumstances, such as posts pushing COVID misinformation, the company says. Sites that directly threaten violence also may be shut down, but account holders are not held responsible for comments on their pages.\nSTARTUP ROCKSTARS IN 2021Sign-in to see our list of the most promising startups of 2021SIGN INThank You!\n    \t\t            For being a subscriber of ETtech Top 5 newsletter.\n    \t\t            \nHere is your chance to spread the word & win exclusive rewards!\n    \t\t        Unlock Rewards\nTwitter has taken a more aggressive approach with Gateway Pundit, permanently suspending the @gatewaypundit account of Jim Hoft, the site\u2019s founder and editor, as well as the account of his twin brother, Joe Hoft, a writer.\n\nJim Hoft declined a request for comment; Joe Hoft did not respond to comment requests.\n\nFacebook and Twitter both have been blasted by right-leaning politicians for what they call censorship of conservative voices. Jim Hoft testified in a 2018 congressional hearing that his site\u2019s traffic from Facebook had tanked after the platform imposed restrictions on the spread of the Pundit\u2019s content, saying such sanctions make \u201cbook burning\u201d look benign.\n\nYet Gateway Pundit\u2019s traffic has boomed: In the wake of the 2020 election, it peaked at nearly 50 million visits a month, according to one estimate, illustrating the power of viral disinformation. Reuters found the site\u2019s often-debunked election-fraud claims were cited in about 100 of more than 800 threatening or harassing messages sent to election officials since last November.\n\nFacebook has long recognized Gateway Pundit as a source of false and divisive content. A July 2019 internal report on \u201cpotential misinformation and polarization risks\u201d listed the site as one of Facebook\u2019s \u201ccommon misinfo offenders.\u201d The report was among a cache of documents provided to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Congress by Frances Haugen, a former Facebook product manager who left the company in May and has been a leading public critic of its practices.\n\nReuters identified a dozen Gateway Pundit stories on Facebook that contained baseless election-fraud claims, two of which Facebook labeled as containing false information. Under four of those stories, nine Facebook users called for the execution of election workers or officials. Only one of those four stories was flagged by Facebook for containing false information.\n\nIn August, Gateway Pundit reported that a Milwaukee official had been threatened after being featured in Pundit stories alleging voter fraud. The result? Even more threats. On the site\u2019s Facebook page, one reader commented: \u201cThere is only one punishment acceptable for traitors, being drawn and quartered.\u201d\n\n\nRead More News ongateway punditfacebookdisinformationfollowersFBwhistleblowerStay on top of technology and startup news that matters.

Agritech firm AgNext Technologies has partnered with NAFED to digitise quality assessment for Arunachal Pradesh\u2019s organic kiwis. These organic kiwis were launched in New Delhi last week by Arunachal Pradesh Agriculture Marketing Board (APAMB) along with NAFED as the marketing partner, under the national \u2018One district One Product\u2019 scheme.\n\n Through its quality monitoring platform \u2018Qualix\u2019, AgNext also enabled deep-tech based comprehensive traceability.

The impact of facilitating quality-based and traceability-enabled trade for kiwis will not only improve domestic demand, but also help in boosting export potential of the fruit.\u201d\n\nSubrat Panda, Chief Technology Officer, AgNext explained the various intersections where technological deployment helped to bring about the traceability solution to the end-consumer, \u201cNAFED connected us with the FPOs in Ziro, Arunachal Pradesh and we deployed our quality assessment solution right at the procurement centre to measure the total soluble sugar (TSS), which is the key parameter to ascertain the ripeness of Kiwi. During the packaging process for retail distribution, each box of kiwis was labeled with a QR code through which one can access the complete inspection report along with key traceability and quality parameters. The entire process is automated and led by integrated AI-based system which significantly reduces the TAT for quality testing, logistics and marketing of the fruit.\u201d\n\nPankaj Prasad, Additional Managing Director (AMD), NAFED, \u201cNAFED has successfully partnered with FPOs in Ziro, Arunachal Pradesh to help them create better market linkages for their certified organic kiwis. Digitized quality assessment helps to streamline the inspection process of the fruit, giving end-consumers a complete traceability report. This empowers both farmers and consumers, resulting in better price realizations, and also builds greater trust and transparency among all the stakeholders in the value chain.

Most benchmark heavyweights plunged, but traders seem to have a different view on smaller stocks that rallied.\n\nAmong those was Vodafone Idea that looks to have found a newfound zeal. Following the price hike last week, the counter has gained substantially. The trend continued on Friday. The stock advanced nearly 13 per cent to Rs 14.44 and took the gains since the price hike to 36 per cent.\n\nMarket commentators, however, have a different view. They don't think the rate hike will solve its long-standing problems. But, it is not the first time the market has had a different view. Neither will it be the last.\nStock Analysis \u2013 Know before investing\n                            Stock score of  Vodafone Idea Ltd  moved up by 2 in a month on a 10-point scale.\n                        \n                        Subscribe Now\n                    Exclusively forStock Analysis \n                    Stock score of Vodafone Idea Ltd is 3 on a scale of 10.\n                View Stock Analysis\u00a0\u00bb\nAmber \u2018fanning\u2019 growth\nWith thrust from the performance-linked incentive (PLI) scheme and China+1 policy of most multinationals, Indian contract manufacturers have seen massive traction in the last few years. The growth in the sector was by the likes of Dixon Tech and Amber Enterprises. Not surprisingly, the market has also rewarded such names.\n\nTo further fuel the growth, AC manufacturer Amber Enterprises acquired a nearly three-fourth stake in Pasio India Private Limited. The latter makes cross flow fans and other plastic parts for the AC industry with plastic parts for refrigeration and other industries.\n\nThe announcement led to a lot of buying in its shares. The counter gained over 7 per cent to Rs 3,257.95. The stock has gained nearly 250 per cent in the last three years and 40 per cent in one year.\n\nPaytm catches on\nShares of Paytm finally found their vigour after the first \u2018Buy\u2019 rating on the stock was announced. The stock, which fell yesterday, saw low-level buying. Dolat Capital has come out with a positive report, bucking the trend, with a target price at Rs 2,500. The price is more than double what others deem fair.\n\nDolat Capital Market said Paytm's transition to a \u201cmanufacturer\u201d of financial services from an agent, cross-selling of services, and strong growth in users will help the company.\n\nThe stock gained nearly 3 per cent to Rs 1,645. However, the stock still trades significantly below the issue price announced after the book-building process.\n\nIPO party continues\nIt seems poor investor response to Rakesh Jhunjhunwala-backed Star Health was a one-off as other primary issues continue to generate a stellar response from the market.\n\nTega Industries, whose bidding process was completed today, saw a whopping 219 times bids. The retail quota was subscribed over 29 times, the institutional quota 215 times and the HNI quota saw a massive 666 times subscription.\n\nThe issue of Anand Rathi Wealth also seems to have generated enough investor interest.

        "Article": "SynopsisYou have to assume that the bull markets will continue unless there is some good reason to believe that they will not continue. AgenciesYes, China has really come down a lot and of course, this will continue because the government has its reform programme in place which will affect a number of companies and industries.You cannot say the COVID situation is necessarily bad for the markets because government policies arising from COVID actually are beneficial to markets, says Mark Mobius, founder at Mobius Capital Partners.\n\nDo you think outperformance by Indian markets is here to stay?\nThank God for the Indian market. We have a heavy weightage in India and our funds have done very well as a result of India and Taiwan. Look, the bull market is not over till it is over. In other words, you have to assume that the bull markets will continue unless there is some good reason to believe that they will not continue. And if we talk to the companies in which we invest in India, we see that they continue to do very well and their earnings are growing, they are innovating. We believe that there is no reason for us to panic or get out even if the market goes down. We probably would buy more of what we have. We have to assume that things will continue to do well. Of course, there will be short time corrections of maybe 10-15% along the way but these will be minor corrections in an undergoing bull market.\n\n\nThere is a leg of decline in Indian stocks 10% on the index, 15%-20% in individual stocks. Are you a buyer?Yes, we continue to look and buy Indian stocks. In our funds, we have certain restrictions on how much we can buy in any one company or country. But we have 20% plus weightage in India, so that is quite a big weighting.\n\n\nThe valuation difference between Korea and India is very large. It is a historical gap like never seen before. Is it not tempting enough for a global investor like you to reduce exposure to India and go to other markets which have underperformed and offer better entry points?Yes, China has really come down a lot and of course, this will continue because the government has its reform programme in place which will affect a number of companies and industries. We are invested in China but we are not in the large companies that are vulnerable to government regulation. We are in the medium size and small size companies and are finding opportunities in China. But such opportunities in India are actually better. The companies are more responsive and the corporate governance has improved dramatically here. We think it is very important -- the ESG culture. All these things combined make us a little bit more optimistic about our holdings in India, rather than China. We continue to look at China but we just have been found the terrific bargains that we can see in India.\n\n\nYou said that you like China but you are still inclined towards India so what is your sense for 2022? Are we in for another year of good double digit returns?Yes, it could continue. The interesting part of all this situation with COVID is that a few months earlier the Fed was saying -- well, look now it is time for us to tighten up and to increase interest rates and so forth and so on. Now, with the threat of a new variant, we are having second thoughts. When that happens, of course, it means that the party is not over because we continue to see governments pop money into these economies. We can see them trying their best to maintain a healthy economy, with low-interest rates. So, this kind of situation is actually good for the markets. It is very ironic on the one hand you could see COVID cases going up but you also see the stock market going up at the same time. Now, you cannot say the COVID situation is necessarily bad for the markets because government policies arising from COVID actually are beneficial to markets.\nPick the best companies to investBECOME AN ETPRIME MEMBERRead More News onMark MobiusIndian marketsChina marketsCovidStock markets(What's moving Sensex and  Nifty  Track  latest market news,  stock tips and  expert advice on  ETMarkets.

        "Article": "SynopsisAmbani, who has been a votary of Indians owning and controlling their own data and the nation drafting strict rules around how digital information is stored and shared, said nations have the right to build and protect strategic digital infrastructure.PTIBillionaire Mukesh Ambani on Friday backed the proposed data privacy and cryptocurrency bills, saying India is putting in place the most forward-looking policies and regulations.\n\nAmbani, who has been a votary of Indians owning and controlling their own data and the nation drafting strict rules around how digital information is stored and shared, said nations have the right to build and protect strategic digital infrastructure.\n\nStating that data is the 'new oil', he said every citizen's right to privacy has to be safeguarded.\n\n\"India is putting in place the most forward-looking policies and regulations,\" he said at the Infinity Forum, hosted by International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA).\n\nThe country, he said, already has a great framework of digital identity \u2013 through Aadhaar, digital bank accounts and digital payments.\n\n\"We are on the verge of introducing data privacy bill, and the cryptocurrency bill. I think we are on the right track,\" he said.\n\nThe comments came as the government looks to bring a new bill in Parliament to treat cryptocurrencies as a financial asset while safeguarding small investors. The legislation may stipulate a minimum amount for investments in digital currencies while banning their use as legal tender.\n\nThe legislative agenda for the current winter session of Parliament that started on November 29 lists bringing of a bill that seeks to prohibit all private cryptocurrencies except \"certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrency and its uses.\"\n\nWhile the government is considering taxing gains from cryptocurrency, the Reserve Bank of India wants a complete ban on digital currencies as it feels this could affect the nation's macroeconomic and financial stability.\n\n\"Data and digital infrastructure is strategically important for India and every other nation in the world. Every country has the right to build and protect this strategic digital infrastructure,\" he said adding a uniform global standard was needed so that cross-border transactions, collaborations and partnerships are not hampered.\n\nStating that every citizen's right to privacy has to be safeguarded, he said the right policies and the right regulatory framework have to balance this with the nation's need to guard data and digital infrastructure.\n\nAmbani, chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries Ltd, said that he was a big believer in blockchain technology.\n\n\"I believe in blockchain technology and this is different from cryptocurrency,\" he said, adding, \"Blockchain is very important for a trust-based, equitable society.\"\n\nWhile the bill for regulating cryptocurrency is in the works, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das is among those who feel that the blockchain technology underpinning cryptocurrencies could exist on its own, even without the currency.\n\n\"Using blockchain, we can deliver unprecedented security, trust, automation and efficiency to almost any type of transaction,\" Ambani said. \"It can be used to modernize our supply chains that form the lifeblood of our economies.\"\n\nIndia is now well on its way to transforming itself into a leading Digital Society, having put the digital infrastructure, and the regulatory framework in place.\n\n\"Data is indeed the 'new oil'. But the new oil is fundamentally different from the traditional oil. Traditional oil was extracted only at select places \u2013 thus, it created wealth only for some countries. In contrast, the new oil -- that is Data -- can be generated and consumed everywhere and by everybody. It has the potential to create value equitably, across sectors, across geographies, across economic classes,\" he said.\n\nHis comments come against the backdrop of a debate on how India should balance user protections with support for its digital economy in the world's fastest-growing major internet market. Foreign companies and hundreds of home-grown startups have flourished amid a dearth of regulation.\n\nAmbani's Jio has supercharged internet adoption, helping crash data prices since launch in 2016, and his group has now created an online-to-offline retail platform take on the likes of Amazon and Walmart-backed Flipkart, which are both betting big on India's e-commerce market.\n\nThe country, he said, is transitioning fully from 2G to 4G. \"We are in the process of creating an equally affordable ecosystem of devices to enable greater adoption, supported by a faster rollout of optical fiber, cloud, and data center infrastructure.\n\n\"The next step will be the connectivity of machines, devices and vehicles, which is the Internet of Things. With 5G rollout next year in India, we are on our way to having one of the most advanced digital infrastructures anywhere in the world.\"\n\nAmbani said India is well on its way to transforming itself into a leading Digital Society, having put the digital infrastructure, and the regulatory framework in place.\n\n\"Finance is at the heart of everything, and I believe we are in very early stages of sporadic digitization, and with various new-age technologies emerging, the opportunity is in adopting a decentralised model of finance,\" he said.\n\nThere will be centralised government and central bank policies, but there will be a path to decentralized technological solutions where finance will be enabled and available to everybody, Ambani said.\n\nReal-time technologies will help settle trades, not in days or hours, but in real-time. Smart contracts will become a reality.\n\n\"Convergence of real-time technologies, distributed ledger, blockchain, smart tokens etc with physical infrastructure using IoT will redefine the decentralized financing sector in a way that we have never imagined,\" he added.\n\nRead More News onmukesh ambanidata privacycryptocurrency billsdigital informationInternational Financial Services Centres AuthoritycryptocurrenciesReserve Bank of Indiablockchain(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

Higher fuel prices had pushed up logistics costs for manufacturers which was trickling down to consumers as higher sticker prices.\n\nHowever, with the Centre cutting excise duty on diesel by Rs 10 per litre last month, freight rates also came down. A few states also reduced taxes on diesel.\n\nSubsequently, as per a report from Crisil research, freight rates declined across 70-75% of the 159 goods and route combinations it reviewed. Rates remained flat for the remaining combinations.\n\nWhile this augurs well for manufacturers and consumers, the lower diesel prices did not result in better margins for the transporters. Free cash flows generated by transporters declined from about 17% of revenue in October to 15% last month given the reduction in goods movement and the competitive nature of the transport industry, the Crisil report noted.\n\nThe rate correction was the lowest for the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector owing to high demand, but it was proportionately higher than the cut in diesel prices in segments like automobiles, textiles, cement and steel.\n\n\u201cIn December rates will go down further,\u201d said Sachin Haritash, director at Chetak Logistics. While larger fleet owners in the organised sector will be more protected due to long-term contracts, freight rates will go down in the open market for smaller operators, he said, adding that even the FMCG sector will see lower goods movement this month.\n\nRead More News onsachin haritashchetak logisticstransport costsnovembergoods(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

In this AFP file photo taken on November 8, 1976 Russian cellist Mstislav Rostropovitch (L) performs during a rehearsal conducted by US conductor Leonard Bernstein (R).PARIS: Leonard Bernstein's score for \"West Side Story\" has become so ubiquitous in Western culture that it has popped up in such unlikely places as Metallica and Wu-Tang Clan albums.\n\nThe original play first appeared on Broadway in 1957, before transferring to the silver screen in 1961, and early reviews suggest that Steven Spielberg's new film version proves the music still resonates today.\n\nThree decades after its appearance, Metallica used a clip from one of its biggest tunes, \"America\", as the surprise intro to \"Don't Tread On Me\" on their seminal \"Black Album\".\n\nOne of the pioneers of hard rock, Alice Cooper, also mined the musical for inspiration on his \"Gutter Cat vs The Jets\" in 1972, using the theme song from one of the rival gangs in the story.\n\nThe inclusions were less obvious when it came to the Wu-Tang Clan sampling elements for \"Maria\" in 1997, from the song of the same name in \"West Side Story\".\n\nThe Wu-Tang's lyrics over the sample -- \"Knew this bitch named Traj, she had a hella fine ashcan ass\" -- seem rather distant from the vibe of the original, though that only emphasises how deeply the musical had embedded itself in American culture.\n\nBernstein, who died in 1990, had not expected the score to have such a long life.\n\nHaving never actually conducted his own score -- either for the stage or screen versions -- he was invited to re-record it with opera singers in 1984.\n\n\"In the documentary about the recording, you can hear him saying that he thought it would have aged badly, but it hadn't at all,\" said Laurent Valiere, host of a new podcast about the movie.\n\n\"The music of 'West Side Story' transcends classical music, with elements of jazz, be-bop and Latin rhythms,\" he added.\n\nAlthough the operatic recording went down as a classic of the genre, it was a fraught process, with Bernstein famously throwing a tantrum at Spanish star tenor Jose Carreras as he struggled with the pronunciation and pacing of playing the all-American Tony.\n\nThe irascible Bernstein, who was head of the New York Philharmonic by then, also grew tired of constantly being reminded of his most famous work.\n\n\"It became a sort of albatross around his neck,\" his daughter told Britain's Radio Times. \"He had to work all the harder to get people to focus on his other works, especially his symphonic works.\"\n\nShe said he spent his whole life \"wishing he could write the great American opera... However, many people will say that 'West Side Story' is the great American opera.\"\n\nThe idea for \"West Side Story\" supposedly came about when Bernstein and playwright Arthur Laurents were sat around a pool in Hollywood and came across a newspaper story about gang warfare.\n\nIt struck them as the perfect framing for the updating of \"Romeo and Juliet\" that they had been searching for.\n\nThe racial element -- with the Puerto Rican Sharks taunted by the white Jets -- resonated with Bernstein, who had struggled through anti-Semitism as a younger man.\n\nThe Puerto Rican element also allowed him to introduce a mambo -- which gives the score a \"hyper-contemporary\" feel, said Valiere.\n\nRead More News onWest Side StoryMetallicaBroadwayWu Tang ClanLeonard BernsteinDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

Moscow has denied planning to invade and accused Ukraine and its Western backers of fabricating claims to cover up their own allegedly aggressive designs.\n\n Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov told lawmakers Friday that the number of Russian troops near Ukraine and in Russia-annexed Crimea is estimated to be 94,300. \n\n \"Our intelligence service analyzes all scenarios, including the worst ones. It notes that a probability of a large-scale escalation on the part of Russia exists. The most probable time when (Russia) will be ready for the escalation is end of January,\" Reznikov said.\n\n The minister noted an escalation \"is a probable scenario, but not certain, and our task is to avert it.\"\n\n Russia and Ukraine have remained locked in a tense tug-of-war after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and threw its weight behind a separatist insurgency in Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland, known as the Donbas. More than 14,000 people have died in the fighting.\n\n Repeated reports about Russia building up troops near Ukraine this year ignited concerns about the conflict intensifying, with tensions growing in recent weeks. \n\n Russia traded fresh accusations and threats with Ukraine, the United States and its NATO allies this week. The West threatened the Kremlin with the toughest sanctions yet if it launches an invasion of Ukraine. \n\n Russia, seeing new U.S. and European support for Ukraine's military, sternly warned that any presence of NATO troops and weapons on Ukrainian soil represents a \"red line.\"\n\n The Kremlin also expressed concern that Ukraine might use force to reclaim control of the country's rebel east.\n\n Reznikov said Ukraine wouldn't do anything to provoke Russia but is prepared to respond in case of an attack.\n\n \"Ukraine is most interested in political and diplomatic resolution,\" the defense minister said.\n\nRead More News onrussiaukrainereznikovukraine borderrussian troops(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

More multimillion-dollar sales of these digital assets that exist on a blockchain and are maintained on networked computers soon followed.\n\nAt the same time, art museums have faced substantial financial shortfalls accelerated by a decline in visitors and donations induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many have considered taking drastic measures, such as selling treasured artworks, to plug budget gaps.\n\nCan NFTs generate the revenue many museums sorely need? Some are issuing their own tokens, including the British Museum and the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures. The Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami accepted an early NFT from a donor. There's even an NFT of entire museum called the Museum of Digital Life.\n\nYet, more than six months into this disruption of the art world, museums have generally engaged very little with NFTs. As researchers who examine both the finances of nonprofit organizations and the growth in NFTs, crypto-assets and other associated blockchain applications, we see four primary reasons why museums have failed to turn the NFT craze into a financial windfall.\n\n\n1. NFTs are complicatedThe people running museums have expertise encompassing art, education and curation. NFTs are an entirely different realm that's quite detached from art and have more in common with crypto-currency than typical artworks like paintings and sculptures.\n\nWhat sets NTFs apart from crypto-currencies like bitcoin and ethereum, which are designed to be interchangeable, is that each NFT represents a unique asset. Figuring out how NFTs must be treated, held and valued is hard, and the ability to quickly mint NFTs for auction is not something that may come naturally to museum staff. What's more, NFTs are typically bought and sold with crypto-currencies, and not many organizations - including museums - regularly make transactions using them.\n\nOn top of any missing financial know-how and a culture that seeks to minimize risks, there are legal complexities and insurance complications. So we can understand why museums have not rushed into the NFT market.\n\n\n2. The monetary upside might be missingThe connection between the ownership of a piece of art and an NFT associated with that artwork can be confusing. Although it may appear otherwise, the NFT is a separate asset from the art itself. The owners of the art retain ownership even after any NFTs derived from that art are minted and sold.\n\nThis separation may mean that the owner of the art has no particular ability to turn an affiliated NFT into a big payoff. Much like the value of a painting has little to do with what the paint, canvas and frame are worth, an NFT's financial value is subjective. It depends on what others are willing to pay.\n\nThe creators of the underlying art, such as musicians and artists who retain control over their work, can - and do - mint NFTs connected to them. Once art is held in a museum collection, however, the value of NFTs is less clear.\n\nMuch like an author-autographed copy of a book can be more valuable than a book without that signature, an NFT minted by an artist of a popular artwork can attract interest from collectors. On the other hand, a book signed by the publisher or an NFT minted by a museum is bound to be less appealing to collectors. An artist-minted NFT that a museum holds could fetch more interest.\n\nStated another way, even if a museum possesses valuable artwork, that does not mean minting NFTs is a guaranteed revenue stream.\n\n\n3. The NFT market values artists, not institutionsOne underlying reason the market for NFTs tied to artwork has thrived is because buyers view purchasing and holding an NFT as a means to interact with and financially support the artist.\n\nMore broadly, the ethos is one of decentralization, and NFT buyers are less likely to be enthusiastic about an intermediary joining the fray.\n\nAn example of the ethos built around supporting artists is the prevalence of smart contracts that secure royalties for the artist that will flow every time an NFT tied to one of their works is sold.\n\nIn fact, the monetization often touted as the primary upside for museums seeking to jump into the NFT market may not be as simple as initially appears.\n\nFirst, museums need to see whether monetizing their existing collections would in any way undermine public access to collections - potentially violating their missions and bylaws. Second, they must have protocols in place to ensure that proceeds from sales tied to the collection are correctly reinvested. And there's a risk that this process could inadvertently lead to pieces of the collection being treated as financial instruments if income is being generated from them rather than solely serving as items on display for the public.\n\nMoving forward, it remains to be seen whether NFTs will financially benefit brick-and-mortar museums, rather than creating new opportunities for virtual ones.\n\n\n4. Volatility and uncertainty make NFTs riskyThough the high prices they can fetch are eye-catching, there are countless cases of NFTs that quickly become worthless.\n\nAnd, as with crypto-currencies, there's lots of volatility. The value of several NFTs have undergone massive and dramatic losses, including ones issued by Grimes, A$AP Rocky and John Cena.\n\nRelying on NFTs to raise cash may be risky, and the boards of museums may determine that it's inappropriate for their charitable organization to own them. That means museums may be forced to quickly liquidate any NFT they mint or receive - even if that sale will make the NFT less valuable to the institution.\n\nAlso, there is still a great deal of uncertainty about what valuable NFTs can do for an art museum's primary goals. They are neither physical in nature nor works of art. Even digital artwork that can be displayed is separate from any NFT derived from it.\n\nTo be sure, NFTs are still new. Banks and other traditional financial institutions initially stood on the crypto-currency sidelines but have slowly assumed a bigger role in those markets. It is certainly possibly that something similar will occur with traditional institutions in the art world as the NFT market matures.\n\n\n(This AP article is republished from The Conversation)\n\nRead More News onNFTNFTSdigital artmuseumsart museumDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

        "Article": "SynopsisIndia\u2019s stance on BOGA is likely to reflect its ongoing position in climate negotiations, where it is part of two key groups\u2014BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India and China) and Like Minded Developing Countries (LMDC). Both groups highlight issues of equity, climate finance and access to emissions budgets allowing for economic development. AgenciesIn the coming years, all eyes will be on how many more governments sign up for BOGA membership, as one of the only tangible initiatives to keep oil and gas in the ground.On November 11, at the recently concluded UN Climate Change Conference (COP 26) in Glasgow, the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA) was launched: a diplomatic initiative led by Denmark and Costa Rica to bring together ambitious governments committed to phasing out oil and gas production. In the aftermath of COP 26, India has been singled out for its resistance to international pressure on coal. But what stance would India adopt on the new oil and gas focused alliance?\n\nTo answer this question, we first need to understand why BOGA was created, and what it aims to do. The alliance is driven by the scientific consensus that there is no room left for fossil fuel expansion. This was a central focus of the Production Gap report, co-sponsored by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), which found that countries plan to produce 120% more fossil fuels by 2030 than would be consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. Similarly, IEA analysis has highlighted that no new development of fossil fuels is possible if we are to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nIn light of this evidence, BOGA members are agreeing to two key things: first, to end the licensing of new oil and gas fields. Second, to set an end-date for existing oil and gas production, consistent with no more than 1.5\u00b0C of average global temperature change. While BOGA\u2019s eleven founding members are not the world\u2019s largest oil and gas producers, BOGA is intended to be a group of \u201cfirst movers\u201d -- high-ambition countries who seek to lead by example.\n\nIndia\u2019s stance on BOGA is likely to reflect its ongoing position in climate negotiations, where it is part of two key groups\u2014BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India and China) and Like Minded Developing Countries (LMDC). Both groups highlight issues of equity, climate finance and access to emissions budgets allowing for economic development. The two issues they most frequently raised during COP 26 were the inability of developed countries to mobilize a long-promised $100 billion per year in climate finance by 2020 and how this jeopardises the enhanced ambition that developing countries are under pressure to provide.\n\nAs such, although not primed to be a \u201cfirst mover\u201d on oil and gas transition, India could see BOGA as an effective way to encourage developed economies to ramp up action\u2014particularly if BOGA can link its objectives to finance and technical support for the Global South.\n\nThat said, for India, the issues raised by BOGA are much less sensitive than anything related to coal, because of its low levels of domestic oil and gas production. India has a high import dependency for both oil and gas: in the financial year 2020, 85% of oil and 53% of gas consumed was imported. The country was the world\u2019s 21st largest oil producer with 771 thousand barrels per day of crude oil that accounted for 0.9 % of global production. And it generated 24 billion cubic meters of natural gas\u20140.6% of the global output\u2014making it the 29th largest producer in the world.\n\nIndia\u2019s interest in BOGA will further be determined by how much the country targets to drive reductions in oil and gas. The government has also committed to ending all energy imports by 2047, aiming to become effectively energy independent. This can only be achieved by massive investments in electric mobility, ethanol and hydrogen, which could in turn enable phase outs of domestic oil and gas production. Conversely, the government has been building extensive new natural gas import and distribution infrastructure, which may drive things in an opposite direction, at least between now and 2030. Much will depend upon how quickly costs fall for new technologies.\n\nIn the coming years, all eyes will be on how many more governments sign up for BOGA membership, as one of the only tangible initiatives to keep oil and gas in the ground. The outcome of COP 26 has certainly highlighted the problems that arise when phase out efforts focus squarely on coal and leave aside oil and gas: it can create a false narrative that northern economies are climate leaders while the Global South is driving climate change. If anything, India should champion BOGA as an example of exactly the kind of ambitious action it has been calling for from advanced economies for decades.\n\n\nThe writer is a Senior Policy Advisor at International Institute for Sustainable Development\n\n(Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer.

Take gold or commodities, there is an asset, unlike that in crypto, there is nothing. There is no asset that is backing it and therefore intrinsic volatility can be very high which also then impacts the attractiveness of crypto as an asset,\" says Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) KV Subramanian. Edited excerpts:\n\nAs journalists, we love to analyse the commas and the dots and the full stops to find the fault lines, but for a change, I must say that things are looking very good for India.\nYes, the last two quarters of growth have been quite good. India emerged among very few countries that have shown four consecutive quarters of positive growth during once-in-a-century pandemic. India dared to be different from the world by not implementing demand-side measures, the Keynesian demand priming. Instead, we followed the Hicks- Samuelson accelerator multiplier framework of focussing on capital expenditures, thereby expanding supply and also the important reforms on the supply side. As a result, growth revived more sharply among emerging economies. We're seeing strong macro fundamentals, whether it is inflation which is less than 5%, a comfortable current account and a fiscal deficit which is less than peer economies.\n\nI want to contrast our performance in the previous crisis, the global financial crisis when we became part of the fragile five because we ended up just doing the Keynesian demand priming. We had double-digit inflation for 18 months, current account deficit that was close to 6% and fiscal deficit that was 2.5 times that of peer economies. As predicted, a V-shaped recovery, together with excellent macro fundamentals, is something that India should be very very happy about. \n\n\nCovid unexpectedly solved two problems \u2013 the big problem was about interest rates, and the second, on forex reserves. But it has created a supply shock that is not going away easily. What looks like a great revival for the commodity and other sectors could also be a function of a supply shock.\nIf you look at the other economies, the US inflation reached a 30-year high. Having lived there for a decade, I can tell you that typically US consumers expect about 2% inflation, now they are getting 6% plus. That's because they have only done measures on the demand side, nothing on the supply side.\n\nCountries like Turkey, Brazil, Mexico are seeing inflation touching close to 20%, and that is because they all did only supply-side measures and did not recognise that Covid is a big supply-side shock. Lockdowns and night curfews lead to supply-side disruptions, and so if you did not account for that and had the clarity and the foresight to take care of that through supply-side measures, that is what would result; that is a textbook illustration of what we learn in macroeconomics. India has been different in that.\n\nYes, commodity prices have gone up significantly, precisely because of the demand going up without a change in supply but for us, if we look at in terms of inflation, a large proportion of our retail inflation side comes from the food economy, about half of retail inflation is food inflation. So while some of the global factors, including commodity prices, will play some role, their role is not as large as that of the domestic factors where the policy measures that we have taken will hold us in good stead.\n\n\nAn impossible divestment like Air India finally has seen the light of the day. But when it comes to the emotional reform, which is the farm reform, it just pours cold water on all the good things one rollback has done.Farming not only in India, in every other democracy, generates disproportionately high emotion. In Germany, while there were protests here last year, German farmers were blocking highways with their tractors.\n\nI wondered why Greta Thunberg and others did not tweet about similar things in western democracies. They singled out the world\u2019s largest democracy which was facing situations that were similar to those in western democracies. The fact remains that emotion is generally high in agriculture across all democracies, and India is not an exception.\nReforms are all intended towards bringing more competition in factor markets, whether it is labour or manufacturing. We have removed some of the obstacles to growth that MSMEs face because of the prowess incentives they had to remain dwarfs, in other words, remain small despite ageing by changing the MSME definitions. \n\nWe have implemented the PLI scheme that incentivises growth because growth is important to reap economies of scale and reduce cost. Put it all together, and you can start seeing that labour, capital, and aspects that affect total factor productivity have been worked on systematically, through policy is showing up in better manufacturing prospects and will show up in service sector growth as well as we go forward. \n\n\nSo concerns regarding becoming competitive in manufacturing have been addressed. But the biggest challenge on the agricultural side, which is the root cause of inflation, remains. Reforms, if not carried, looking at the structure of the agriculture supply chain, food and vegetable prices will stubbornly remain strong, and we will always keep on troubling you with your view on inflation with no solution in sight.As I mentioned earlier, half of inflation in India comes from food inflation. That's because we do not have enough storage infrastructure.\n\nOne aspect in which agriculture is different from other areas is that while demand is all through the year, supply is seasonal. Therefore, storage is something that is intrinsically extremely important in agriculture. If you look at every advanced economy, they have provided incentives for storage. In India, however, under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, all storage is treated as hoarding.\n\nIf every storage is hoarding, how will you ever provide incentives for infrastructure for storage to come up. In which case, you'll have volatility because whenever supply changes, demand remains the same. We do not have enough storage infrastructure for onions, potatoes, vegetables, milk, eggs that are needed throughout the year.\n\nI think because we have not provided incentives. Overall, agriculture needs far more markets to be functioning. It's incredibly important to improve the prospects of small and marginal farmers. They are the ones that hurt when we do not have opportunities for them.\n\nIt is a simple point that every other producer in India can go and sell the produce wherever he or she wants except the small and marginal farmer.\n\nThere is a lot of rhetoric here, but when you look at the reality, we have undermined the opportunities for the small and marginal farmers, and rhetoric is not enough. Right now, we need the small and marginal farmer to be taken care of by enabling the opportunities that markets provide to reach him.\n\n\nWhat is your take on cryptocurrency? Are you worried about its existence in India?A distinction needs to be made between crypto as an asset and crypto as a currency. Currencies have always been issued by sovereigns and, for a good reason. What keeps providing credence to that currency is that the sovereign backs it. So I think that is very important to remember.\n\nThe second point is when you think about crypto, as an asset, an important aspect is that there is no underlying backing the price of crypto.\n\nIf you take stock, for instance, the equity stock, the cash flows of that firm is what is backing that stock. Take gold or commodities, there is an asset, unlike that in crypto, there is nothing. There is no asset that is backing it and therefore intrinsic volatility can be very high which also then impacts the attractiveness of crypto as an asset itself because historically again assets have been those that have had typically more stable values and something that is underlying so that is the second aspect.\n\nThe third point which we actually must remember is that whenever you take a financial innovation that is a zero-sum game, in other words, has no benefits for the real sector or maybe minimal benefits for the real sector that has to be treated very cautiously.\n\nThe example that I use to illustrate this is tomorrow if you and I decide to sit and play cards with each other and then what might happen is that money will change hands maybe you might become richer at my expense but collectively the two of us will hold the same amount of money that we started with at the start of the day and we would have not done, no real activity during that time, real economy would not have benefited anything from that activity that we did. This is what happens with a zero-sum game as well, money changes hands but does not necessarily flow into the real sector.\n\nI think it is very clear that unlike those in the crypo world that claim crypto is a panacea, the truth is somewhere clearly in between.\n\n\nWhat is that one handover you would like to give to your successor?My successor should have both the self-confidence and the courage to have his or her imprint on policy.\n\nA few bits of advice that I would hazard giving would be that when we are in positions like this, we have to behave in a manner that engenders trust with people we work with.\n\nI think that is incredibly important. All the arguments that we do construct for policy are important, they are necessary, we have to have enormous rigour backing each one of the recommendations that we take but eventually, trust is also important, and I think in that aspect, I would say that it certainly is not a good idea to behave in an I, me, myself manner. I think staying within the Lakshman Rekha and being a good team player is incredibly important because that generates trust. \n\n\nPick the best companies to investBECOME AN ETPRIME MEMBERRead More News onCryptocurrenciesCryptoFarm reformsInflationKV Subramanian(What's moving Sensex and  Nifty  Track  latest market news,  stock tips and  expert advice on  ETMarkets.

Once the regulator gives its nod, the fund houses will open their schemes to investors.iStockIndian mutual fund investors would soon be able to invest in silver ETFs. Two fund houses Mirae Asset Mutual Fund and Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund have filed documents with the regulator for approval. \n\nThis is after the markets regulator SEBI laid down operating norms for silver ETFs in late November. Once the regulator gives its nod, the fund houses will open their schemes to investors. \n\nMany investors use gold and silver as part of asset allocation for their portfolios and to hedge against rising inflation. While gold ETFs were present, investors could buy silver only in physical form so far. \n\n\u201cIn asset allocation, silver ETF can be used to diversify your portfolio as it has a historically lower correlation with stocks/bonds,\u201d says Swarup Mohanty, Chief Executive Officer, Mirae Asset Mutual Fund. Mohanty points out that both gold and silver are used by investors to protect portfolios against inflation.\n\nPost the pandemic, investors' demand for physical precious metals (particularly gold and silver) has increased because they are presumed to provide a safe haven, especially at times of uncertainty. \n\nDemand for silver is also influenced by industrial users, thus may also contribute towards the performance of silver ETF and benefit the investor, say financial planners. \n\nRead More News onsilver etfETFsinvestinginvestorsMirae Asset Mutual FundAditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund(Catch all the latest news about  mutual funds, MF insights & analysis, best buys and investment trends on  ETMutualFunds.com)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

        "Article": "SynopsisIf boosters don\u2019t work well against the variant, vaccine developers will need to make new shots.iStockResearchers then tested seven vaccines as boosters including AstraZeneca and Pfizer.RelatedShould we worry too much about getting Covid from young kids?With Covid vaccination & booster shots, should we worry about Omicron? What is known and still unknownWith dozens of new mutations, does Omicron cause only mild illness? What we know about new Covid variantLiving in the moment: Indians indulge in luxury & experience-oriented spendingOmicron: The new Covid variant has about 30 mutations, recovered people can catch it againPeople looking for a booster shot of a COVID-19 vaccine probably don\u2019t need to fret about what brand it is: Many combinations of shots are likely to provide strong protection, according to a large new study.\n\nIn a comparison of seven vaccine brands, British researchers found that most of them prompted a strong immune response, with the mRNA shots from Moderna and Pfizer eliciting the largest responses. The study was published Thursday in The Lancet.\n\n\u201cThese are welcome data for policymakers,\u201d said Merryn Voysey, a statistician at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the study. \u201cThe most significant take-home message here is that there are a large number of excellent boosting options for third doses.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s too soon for researchers to say much about how well vaccine boosters will work against the new omicron variant, which has mutations that may allow it to evade some of the antibodies produced by existing COVID-19 vaccines. Some researchers suspect that people would need a very high level of antibodies to protect against it.\n\nAll of the study\u2019s 2,878 volunteers initially received two shots of either the AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccines. (Both of those vaccines are authorized in Britain; shots by Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson have been authorized in the United States.)\n\nResearchers then tested seven vaccines as boosters: Along with AstraZeneca and Pfizer, they tried three brands that have been authorized in various countries: Johnson & Johnson, Moderna and Novavax. They also tried two shots that have not been authorized anywhere: an mRNA vaccine from CureVac, and a vaccine from Valneva made from inactivated coronaviruses. Finally, some of the volunteers received a meningitis vaccine as a control.\n\nAfter four weeks, researchers collected blood samples from the volunteers and measured their antibody levels. They also looked for immune cells, known as T cells, that specifically attack other cells infected with the coronavirus.\n\nAntibodies and T cell levels increased in people who received a COVID-19 booster shot compared with those who got the meningitis vaccine. The range was quite large, however. People who got the Valneva booster after a Pfizer vaccine saw only a 30% increase above the control group. But a Moderna booster produced at least a 1,000% increase.\n\nThe new study also found that boosters increased T cells that recognize the coronavirus. Antibodies may be good at knocking the coronavirus out early in an infection, when the virus is colonizing the nose. But deep in the airway, T cells may provide a second line of defense.\n\nThe trial did not follow the volunteers to see how well the booster shots actually prevented infection or disease. But in recent months, researchers have shown that measuring antibody levels can be a pretty good way of predicting the effectiveness of a vaccine.\n\nMost of the boosters used in the study raised antibodies to a level that would be the equivalent of at least 90% protection against infection. And the mRNA vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna produced much higher antibody levels than the other vaccines did.\n\n\u201cI would say whatever you had first time around, having an mRNA booster is probably a good idea,\u201d said Eleanor Riley, an immunologist at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the new study.\n\nStill, other scientists said, most of the other vaccines in the study performed strongly enough that people should feel comfortable getting them as well.\n\n\u201cIf your country or region of the world only has one of the vaccines that we\u2019ve shown can boost, that will be fine to use as a booster and safe to do it,\u201d said Saul Faust, an infectious disease expert at the University of Southampton and a co-author of the study. \u201cIt\u2019s not all about mRNA.\u201d\n\nJohn Moore, a virus expert at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York who was not involved in the study, said that people should not make too much out of the modest differences among most of the vaccines.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t regard it as a beauty contest, in the sense of which one is slightly higher than another one,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to be too precious about this.\u201d\n\nMoore said that the new study could give public health officials the confidence to turn to different vaccines for boosters, depending on which was most convenient. Novavax and Johnson & Johnson, for example, make vaccines that can be stored in refrigerators, whereas mRNA vaccines have to be kept frozen.\n\nAn inevitable shortcoming of the new study was that researchers did not measure the boosters against the new omicron variant. Only discovered last month, omicron has raised serious concerns among researchers because of its many mutations. A booster that is 90% effective against the original strain might do worse against omicron.\n\nJust how much worse is unknown. Experiments on omicron haven\u2019t started because scientists must first figure out how to grow the variant in a laboratory. Faust and his colleagues have already sent blood samples from the trial volunteers to British government labs, where researchers will see how well their boosted antibodies and immune cells work against omicron. \u201cI think we\u2019ll be starting to see those results in a few weeks,\u201d Faust said.\n\nIf boosters don\u2019t work well against the variant, vaccine developers will need to make new shots, said Dr. Stanley Plotkin, a vaccine expert and University of Pennsylvania emeritus professor. The mRNA vaccines could be rapidly adapted to target omicron\u2019s mutations, he added, or researchers could try a more challenging approach: a universal vaccine against any coronavirus.\n\n\u201cAssuming that omicron escapes antibodies to the original virus and the current variants, then we have to have a different philosophy,\u201d he said.\n\nRead More News onCovid 19coronavirusCovid booster shotsCovid vaccineOmicronCovid variantDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana (PM-KISAN) -- under which eligible marginal farmers have electronically given Rs 6,000 annually in three equal instalments -- saw a 14.22 lakh pending failed transaction during 2019-20 fiscal, when the scheme was launched in February 2019. \n\nConsequently, the number of pending failed transactions was reduced to 8.19 lakh during 2020-21 fiscal. But in the ongoing 2021-22 fiscal, the number of pending failed transactions stood at 9.11 lakh till November 30, the data showed. \n\nAccording to the data, the amount that was pending for reprocessing due to failed transactions was Rs 182.78 crore during 2019-20 fiscal, Rs 163.99 crore in 2020-21 fiscal, and Rs 28.47 crore till November of 2021-22 fiscal. \n\nThe total amount that is pending for reprocessing from 2019-20 till November 20 of this year under the PM-KISAN scheme stands at 374.78 crore, the data showed. \n\nIn a written reply to the Upper House, the agriculture minister said failed transactions remained less than one per cent so far since the launch of the PM-KISAN scheme. \n\n\"Under the PM-KISAN scheme, the total number of transactions that have taken place is 80,27,44,674, of which the number of failed transactions is less than one per cent,\" he noted. \n\nTomar said the cumulative number of failed transactions of PM-KISAN were at 69,02,227 from February 1, 2019, till November 30 of this year. \n\nOut of which, 32,02,408 transactions were successfully reprocessed, Tomar said. \n\nThe minister said various reasons have been identified by the Centre for the transaction's failure under the PM-KISAN scheme, such as account closed or transferred, invalid IFSC code, account inactive, account dormant, amount exceeding the limit set on account by the bank for credit/debit per transaction, among others. \n\nTo tackle the issues of transaction failures, and re-process the payment of such registered farmers' families, Tomar said a standard operating procedure has been developed and issued to all states for necessary action at their end. \n\nIn cases where the corrective measures are to be taken by states/UTs, such transaction failure records are opened to the respective state/UT for correction under the \"Correction Module\" tab of the PM-KISAN portal. \n\nThereafter, all the transaction failure records are reprocessed for the payment of the respective instalment under the PM-KISAN Scheme, he added. \n\nTomar also mentioned that his ministry through weekly video conferencing takes up the matter with state governments to expedite the resolution of the issue and reprocess the failed transactions for the payments of the respective instalments under the scheme. \n\nFurther, the minister said the responsibility to identify the beneficiaries and upload their correct and verified data on the PM-KISAN portal lies with the respective state government. \n\nThe data received on the PM-KISAN web portal goes through various levels of verification and validation, including Aadhar and income tax databases. Subsequently, the financial benefits are passed onto the eligible beneficiaries, he added. \n\nUnder the PM-KISAN Scheme, more than 11.60 crore farmers have been given the financial benefits of approximately Rs 1.60 lakh crore through various instalments since the launch of the scheme, Tomar said, responding to another query.\nRead More News onkisanpm kisantomarparliamentupper house(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

Bigger enterprises will look for smaller spaces to accommodate their employees on a shift basis,\u201d said Abhay Chawla, COO, India Accelerator. With investment pipeline of one million USD, the company plans to reach 300,000 sq ft of operational area by FY 22-23. \n\n\u201cBesides this, the start-ups that are emerging in tier 2 & 3 cities will also see the occupancy in local coworking spaces. By adopting stringent safety norms and hygiene practices, the coworking industry will support the new working models and witness an exponential boom in the upcoming period of market recovery,\u201d Chawla added. \n\nCo-working spaces are expected to see a rise in absorption of seats of up to 30%, according to industry experts. Seat absorption is about 15% of the total office leasing by corporates in 2021 and the share is expected to increase further.\n\n\u201cAnticipating businesses being resilient, coworking spaces are expected to emerge stronger in the post covid world. The flexibility and well-crafted strategies to promote a preventive and safe coworking environment are going to attract startups as well as conventional businesses,\u201d he added.\n\nCompany currently operates 55,000 sq ft in NCR.

Market experts said volatility might remain high going ahead. They see 17,150, followed by levels around 16,800 as key supports. They see the range of 17,500-600 as a key hurdle zone.\n\nSustaining above the 17,149 level is crucial as it also coincides with the 100-day exponential moving average (EMA), said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in.\n\n\"If the Nifty registers a close below 17,149 level, it may signal the end of a pullback attempt that is in progress from the lows of 16,782.

The new-look can also be turned on or off using the Coming Soon megaphone icon in the top right-hand corner of Word, OneNote, PowerPoint and Excel. \n\nThough the design changes are very subtle, Microsoft has also teased more dramatic changes to its Office UI, which included moving toward more of a command bar instead of the traditional ribbon interface.\n\nAs per The Verge, it's still expected to see these changes appear in the web and mobile versions of Office first, and Microsoft did say last year that its bigger Office UI changes could take a year or two to roll out.\n\nThe new Office UI update is currently available for all Windows 11 users.

The military is currently fortifying its western and northern borders as tensions with China fester.AgenciesIndia\u2019s earlier talks with the Russians on using more locally-manufactured parts were inconclusive and HAL had since developed a light utility helicopter similar to the Kamov, the officials said, asking not to be named citing rules for speaking to the media.India won\u2019t go ahead with building Russian helicopters locally under a $1 billion deal when President Vladimir Putin visits New Delhi next week, according to senior government officials with knowledge of the matter, complicating plans to modernize the world\u2019s third largest military force.\n\nInstead, there might be off-the-shelf purchases of some of the Ka-226T military choppers as the Indian Air Force needs to make immediate replacements to its fleet of over 320 aging helicopters. The military is currently fortifying its western and northern borders as tensions with China fester. \n\nIndia initially inked the deal in 2015 with the Russians for 200 of the Kamov twin-engine utility helicopters. Of this, 60 choppers were to be imported and the remaining would be manufactured locally under a venture between the Bengaluru defense public sector unit, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and Russian Helicopters.\n\nHowever, the Kamov project had very few backers within a government that was keen on boosting the local defense manufacturing under Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s \u201cMake-in India\u201d initiative, one of the senior officials said. Also, helicopters with coaxial rotors like the Kamov are costlier to maintain in comparison to the traditional ones, the official said.\n\nIndia\u2019s earlier talks with the Russians on using more locally-manufactured parts were inconclusive and HAL had since developed a light utility helicopter similar to the Kamov, the officials said, asking not to be named citing rules for speaking to the media.\n\nNew Delhi has gone ahead with ordering 12 helicopters from HAL. These choppers have cleared most of the field tests and will come under a limited series production, the officials said, just as the Karnataka-based manufacturing plant gets online. \n\nHAL and India\u2019s Ministry of Defence didn\u2019t immediately comment. Russia\u2019s state arms-export agency declined to comment immediately on possible deals ahead of the summit\n\nOver 70% of India\u2019s military helicopters are three decades old with the rest in service for almost 50 years, often requiring refitting and maintenance. The Indian army is now making do with just three-quarters of the fleet for reconnaissance and observation, a senior military officer said on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe latest accident involving these choppers was in September when a Cheetah helicopter crashed in Jammu and Kashmir, killing two pilots. In the last decade, as many as 19 personnel have died in such incidents.\n\nThe bulk of these light utility helicopters are used also for casualty evacuations, ferrying men and hardware to the Himalayas. Most have to be decommissioned from 2023.\n\nRead More News onIndiaRussiaRussia HelicoptersIAFNarendra Modi(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

        "Article": "SynopsisWhile November 2016 was due to the demonetisation and the March and April of the same year could be attributed to seasonal year-end bulge, Soumya Kanti Ghosh, the chief economic adviser to the State Bank Group, said in a note on Friday.AgenciesAccording to the provisional RBI data for the fortnight to November 19, the aggregate deposits of commercial banks have slumped by Rs 2.7 lakh crore. The massive fortnightly spike in bank deposits by a whopping Rs 3.3 lakh crore -- the fifth biggest rise in 24 years -- for the fortnight to November 5, 2021, and a subsequent plunge of Rs 2.7 lakh crore in the next fortnight can be due to the expected IPO boom and subsequent poor show in the later weeks, argues an SBI Research report. Such a massive deposit accretion has never happened during a Diwali week as there is always a currency leakage and concomitant deposit decline, says an SBI Research report, adding this is also the fifth largest increase in any fortnight in the past 24 years since 1997 and the Rs 2.69 lakh crore subsequent deposit slump for the fortnight to November 19 is the largest since 1997. \n\n Such a huge incremental addition has happened only a few times: during the fortnight to November 25, 2016 by Rs 4.16 lakh crore after the note ban, for the fortnight to September 26, 2016 by Rs 3.55 lakh crore, March 29 2019 by Rs 3.46 lakh crore and April 1, 2016 by Rs 3.41 lakh crore, said the report. \n\n While November 2016 was due to the demonetisation and the March and April of the same year could be attributed to seasonal year-end bulge, Soumya Kanti Ghosh, the chief economic adviser to the State Bank Group, said in a note on Friday. \n\n According to the provisional RBI data for the fortnight to November 19, the aggregate deposits of commercial banks have slumped by Rs 2.7 lakh crore. The slump in deposits follows an abrupt increase by Rs 3.3 lakh crore in the previous fortnight ending November 5, 2021-- this was 36 per cent of the incremental deposit growth for the period to Rs 9.35 lakh crore. \n\n In fact, the Rs 3.3 lakh crore fortnightly deposit bulge is the fifth largest fortnightly increase since 1997 and the Rs 2.69 lakh crore subsequent deposit slump (fortnight ended Nov'19) is the largest since 1997. \n\n Such an increase in deposits and subsequent slump is quite a contrarian trend, he said, adding while it is difficult to decipher the increase and subsequent decline, it does poses questions on liquidity management/financial stability or a shift in behavioural trend in customer payment habits through digitisation and hence lower currency leakage and concomitant deposit bulge or both. \n\n On the fortnightly deposit slump in the subsequent days period, Ghosh said \"it was possible that there was a large influx of deposits into banking system for the fortnight to November 5, 2021 in anticipation of a build up in rally in stock markets post-primary issuances of new age companies and others. However, when such a rally did not materialise, deposits slumped and almost 80 per cent of incremental deposit was withdrawn\". \n\n \"Interestingly, the money parked in fixed reverse repo window jumped from Rs 0.45 lakh crore on October 19 to Rs 2.4 lakh crore on November 19, and has remained at such level till December 1, 2021,\" he said, adding it must however be noted that the significant jump in digital transactions has also resulted in lower usage of cash in current fiscal and ideally could also have resulted in surge in deposits for the Diwali week. \n\n Meanwhile, if quarterly banking deposit data show that though deposits growth remained same in Q2 at 2.6 per cent over 2.5 per cent in Q1, sequentially at the national level, apart from the metro regions, deposits growth has decelerated in Q2 over Q1, especially in rural areas, indicating that the current economic recovery is mostly urban led and rural economy is still recouping, it said. \n\n But at the same time bank credit has risen Rs 1.18 lakh crore or 7.1 per cent on-year during the fortnight to November 5, may be due to festive demands and then declined by Rs 1,157 crore during the fortnight to November 19, the report added. \n\n On the possible reason of the IPO rush, Ghosh noted the massive influx of new investors that began since the lockdowns began in March 2020 and which got accelerated in the past few months even as bank deposits have decelerated. \n\n According to NSE data, monthly investor registrations rose to record-high levels in September 2021 to the tune of 15.6 lakh. Almost 50 lakh additional new investors have been registered with brokerages between April and September 2021 over the same period in 2020. \n\n If deposits and credit grew by Rs 5 lakh crore during the rest of the FY22 (from November 19, 2021 to Mar 25, 2022), then the deposits growth will be around 12 per cent and credit growth around 8.5 per cent in 2021-22.\nRead More News onbank depositsNovemberReportIPOSBI Research(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

        "Article": "Shree Bose\u2019s company to teach computer science and robotics through learning kits  EdTech startup Piper Learning Inc., founded by Indian-American Shree Bose, is all set to start sales of Made-in-India products via Amazon and Flipkart in 2022. The California-based company, in association with Brand Capital and the Times Group of India, plans to bring easy-to-learn engineering and computer science concepts to students. \u201cWe want the magic of Piper\u2014building with technology physically while experiencing virtual, storytelling-based lessons\u2014to be accessible to everyone,\u201d said Shree. \u201cWith the COVID-19 pandemic, as students have been in lockdown for months, learning has largely moved online. So we wanted to create an experience that allows students to use their computers in a different way than simply for their online classes, which is exactly what Piper Make allows anyone to do.\u201d Piper was founded by Bose in 2014 while she was a Harvard University student. With an aim to help students around the world struggling to gain a foothold in exploring technology, Piper creates electrical engineering and computer science kits for children aged more than 8 years. Bose won the Grand Prize at the inaugural Google Global Science in 2011 and held conversations with students across the world regarding her journey as a STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) student.  The Piper Computer Kit, the company\u2019s flagship product, blends physical building with electronics and gameplay in the virtual world, using the Raspberry Pi Edition of Minecraft. The award-winning STEM company launched Piper Make, their online coding platform, in March 2021. Piper Make allows students to convert their personal computer into a powerful prototyping station using simple hardware and electronics paired with free, drag-and-drop coding lessons in kits designed for everyone, from amateur to advanced users. With representations of the Raspberry Pi Pico, the bite-sized microcontroller that powers the lessons, translations of Google Blockly code to Circuit Python, and more, Piper Make is designed to empower anyone to learn the basics of hardware and coding. With a high demand for robotics across the world, Piper launched its Piper Make Robotics Expedition Kit, an add-on to their Piper Make platform, during the holiday season. With servo motors and custom laser-cut wood pieces that can be assembled using an engineering Blueprint, the Kit enables users to get started with story-based online lessons. This new Robotics Expedition Kit gives kids hands-on experience building the robots they see in the world around us.  As a company largely focused in the United States, Piper has quickly grown into a global brand with products in over 50,000 homes in every continent.  Talking about her journey, Bose, who belongs to Kolkata, said that her grandfather\u2019s cancer diagnosis and struggle sparked her exploration. \u201cI\u2019m excited to bring the opportunities I have been lucky to have to the next generation of Indian innovators. I\u2019m confident that with a solid foundation in technology, confidence around building with hardware, and the innovative spirit of getting started with Piper, India will be a source of solutions to the world\u2019s big challenges. I\u2019m excited for Piper to be a part of it.\u201d PRESS CONTACT: Shree Bose Co-founder, Piper Inc.  shree@playpiper.com  TO LEARN MORE ABOUT PIPER: \u2022 Visit playpiper.com  \u2022 Follow us on LinkedIn \u2022 Like Piper on Facebook \u2022 Follow Piper on Twitter \u2022 Follow Piper on Instagram \u2022 Visit Piper on Vimeo or YouTube  Disclaimer: This article has been produced on behalf of Piper by Mediawire team.(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

The company said its disruptive model has not only gathered space, but also achieved desired outcomes in the sector, thereby supplementing the government's initiatives in improving emergency care delivery in the hinterlands of the country. \n\nCIPACA, which started services in 2015, said in a release that it has been able to make small hospitals in rural areas offer affordable top class ICU services without a worry on sustenance of their operations and create job opportunities for educated rural young women through adequate training programme. \n\nIn the last six months, CIPCA not only expanded its presence beyond Tamil Nadu, but also reached states like Tripura to manage ICU operations. Currently, CIPACA manages 24x7 ICU operations in 15 hospitals located in the hinterlands across South, West and Eastern parts of the country. \n\n\"We are happy to report on the impressive progress we are making on the rural ICU mission. It is no mean feat to make available top class ICU and emergency services in the remotest parts of the country in a short period\", CIPACA founder and Managing Director, Dr Raja Amarnath said. \n\n\"One can see the real benefits of our mission in the hospitals we have tied-up. Each one of them is providing golden hour treatment at an affordable price. We have been recognized as Best Quality Rural ICU care providers at national level\", he said. \n\nCIPACA claimed its model helped arrest loss of revenue about 30-50 per cent to small hospitals due to quality ICU care and the hospitals also managed to widen the scope of healthcare services. \n\nThe Director of MS Multispecialty Hospital at Pithapuram in Andhra Pradesh, Dr Suresh Babu said, \"while we have well-structured 24x7 ICU operations, CIPACA's entry has given us confidence to add more specialties\" \"We will add paediatrics and general surgery operations soon.\" \n\nCIPACA said running ICU operations require well-trained para-medical staff and medical technicians. Many hospitals had to shut their ICU operations in the past due to non-availability of trained staff and other viable issues, it said. \n\nCIPACA has been focusing on bridging the skill gap through its own ICU staff training programmes, the statement added.\nRead More News onicucipacaintensive care unitandhra pradeshHealthcare IndiaHealthcare(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

NEW DELHI: While many foreign institutional investors are pulling money out of India, renowned emerging markets investor Mark Mobius remains confident of the strength of the bull market in the country.\n\nMobius, though, says there is a good possibility of 10-15 per cent correction in the ongoing bull market, but that is \u201cminor\u201d given the humongous rally we have seen in the last one and a half years.\n\nAccording to data available with NSDL, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have withdrawn nearly Rs 29,500 crore from the equity markets since October. They say other markets present better alpha than India now given that valuations have surged significantly here.\n\nIn an interview with ET Now, Mobius said he saw corrections as a good opportunity to buy into the markets. \u201cDon\u2019t think there will be any reason for us to get out even in a correction. Expect the bull run to continue in the markets,\u201d he said.\n\nIndian stock markets have seen a lot of volatility in the last one month. Since hitting an all-time high in October, benchmark indices have lost about 7 per cent because of inflationary pressure and rising Covid-19 cases across the world, among other things.\n\nMobius said he was invested in stocks such as Polycab, Apollo Tubes and Persistent Systems. The investor also expressed interest in small banks that have grown rapidly, though he has avoided financials because they were already a big part of the indices.\n\nMobius did not seem too excited by the frenzy in primary markets. He said he would rather skip initial public offers (IPOs) as they were perfectly priced. Moreover, a lot of tech companies were riding on hopes and forecasts rather than earnings.\n\nThis view has been echoed by many other value investors also. They point out that in a consolidation phase, companies delivering consistent profit growth tend to outperform and those delivering losses fall behind. Most of the recently listed tech companies are loss-making.\n\nMobius said Indian markets have benefited greatly from supportive government policies. Moreover, Indian companies have vastly improved corporate governance and were relatively more focussed on ESG factors. The investment guru said he would continue to buy Indian stocks, which already have over 20 weights in his funds.\n\nThe world over, markets have been concerned over the emergence of the Omicron variant of coronavirus. Some health experts have said it was relatively more infectious. However, Mobius said this might not necessarily be bad for the markets. For him, the bigger risk was any drastic change in government policy.\n\nRecently, the Modi government was forced to roll back three farm laws in the face of continued protests. Those farm laws were described as market-friendly. Some political commentators said the government did so to not face the wrath of farmers during the upcoming state elections.\n\nIf the government brings any more regulations or laws that are anti-markets, the stock market might not take it kindly.\n\nMobius said investors should keep at least 10 per cent gold in their portfolio. Cryptocurrencies can not be an alternative to them as they can not be termed as investments. He called them rather speculative assets.\n\nPick the best companies to investBECOME AN ETPRIME MEMBERRead More News onMark Mobius | Indian stocksMark MobiusMark Mobius Stock PortfolioGoldCryptocurrencyIPOs(What's moving Sensex and  Nifty  Track  latest market news,  stock tips and  expert advice on  ETMarkets.

Both these accounting treatments would result in higher headline numbers for NBFCs,\" it said.\n\nIt may so happen that NBFCs would disclose NPA numbers as per IRAC norms and stage 3 numbers as per Ind-As separately in their disclosures, the agency said.\n\nRead More News onnbfcnon banksnbfc debtrbinpabad loan(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

What makes Omicron a variant of concern (VoC)? And how concerned should we be? The Health Ministry issued \na statement on Friday answering the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on the new Covid-19 variant. Here is what you need to know:\n\n\nWhat is Omicron and what makes it a variant of concern?B.1.1.529 or Omicron is a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 that was reported in South Africa on 24th November this year. \n\nThis variant has shown a particularly large number of mutations, especially on the viral spike protein which is the key target of the immune response.\n\n\"Given the collection of mutations in Omicron, which earlier individually have been associated with increased infectivity and/or immune evasion, and the sudden rise in number of positive cases in South Africa, World Health Organization has declared Omicron as a Variant of Concern (VoC),\" the health ministry said.\n\n\nCan current diagnostics methods like RT-PCR detect Omicron?\nRT-PCR is the most accepted and commonly used method of diagnosis for SARS-CoV- 2 variant as it detects specific genes in the virus, such as Spike (S), Enveloped (E) and Nucleocapsid (N), etc, to confirm the presence of the coronavirus. \n\nIn the case of Omicron, the S gene is heavily mutated, and some primers may lead to results indicating the absence of the S gene. \n\n\"This particular S gene drop out along with the detection of other viral genes could be used a diagnostic feature of Omicron. However, for final confirmation of the omicron variant genomic sequencing is required,\" it said.\n\nHow concerned should we be about the new VoC?\n\"It is important to highlight that Omicron has been declared VoC based on the observed mutations, their predicted features of increased transmission and immune evasion, and preliminary evidence of detrimental change in COVID-19 epidemiology, such as increased reinfections,\" the statement read.\n\nHowever, the definitive evidence for increased remission and immune evasion is still awaited.\n\nWhat precautions should we take?\nThe same Covid-appropriate behaviour as before, which includes face masks, vaccinations, social distancing, and maintaining good ventilation.\n\n\nWill there be a third wave?\nThe scale and magnitude of the rise in Omicron cases, and most importantly the severity of disease that will be caused, is still not clear. \n\nCases are increasingly being reported from countries besides South Africa, and given its characteristics, it is likely to spread to more countries, including India, the ministry explains.\n\n\"Given the fast pace of vaccination in India and high exposure to delta variant as evidenced by high seropositivity, the severity of the disease is anticipated to be low. However, scientific evidence is still evolving,\" it added.\n\nWill the existing vaccines work against Omicron?\nVaccines are expected to still offer protection against severe disease and there is no evidence currently to suggest otherwise. \n\nSome of the mutations reported on the Spike gene may decrease the efficacy of existing vaccines. \"However, vaccine protection is also by antibodies as well as by cellular immunity, which is expected to be relatively better preserved,\" it said.\n\nRead More News onFAQsthird waveOmicronVariant of concernomicron VariantWhat is OmicronOmicron variant newsOmicron variant updates(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

As we see the (rising) numbers every day, we are very concerned about it,\" Makhura said, as he made a plea to residents of the province to step up to get vaccinated. \n\n The premier said that since Monday, there were over 50,000 vaccinations a day from the low of 30,000 daily before the announcement of the new variant. \n\n \"If we sustain the daily vaccination of 50,000 throughout this period into the festive season, it will help us to reach at least another half a million people before they leave Gauteng,\" he said. \n\n Makhura was referring to the annual exodus to rural areas outside the province by workers in Gauteng as business and industry shuts down from mid-December for several weeks until early in the new year. \n\n \"We need to catch people here in Gauteng and vaccinate them because we know that during the festive season millions of people leave our province. We don't want people to be carrying this variant to other provinces, especially those who are not vaccinated,\" he explained. \n\n Joining Makhura at the briefing was Gauteng COVID-19 Command Council chairperson Dr Mary Kawonga, who said the province was already seeing a spike in cases. \n\n \"The rate at which cases are increasing and the fact that we actually two days ago passed the seven-day rolling average that was the threshold for the third wave means that we are in a resurgence, and we need to behave like we are already in the (fourth) wave, without waiting for the technical definition,\" she said. \n\n Kawonga said the peak of the fourth wave was expected in about two weeks, with about 45,000 active cases and about 4,000 hospitalisations at the peak. \n\n \"Remember, this is the modelling and the prediction. Depending on how we are able to vaccinate and how we adhere to non-pharmaceutical interventions, it is very possible that whatever is predicted might not come to pass,\" she opined. \n\n Another member of the Council, Professor Bruce Melado, believed that although a higher peak would likely occur during the fourth wave, there would be fewer deaths. \n\n \"We should expect at least 4,000 (deaths) compared to the 9,500 during the third peak,\" Melado said, adding that the high levels of community transmissions were expected to continue into January.\nRead More News onafricasouth africaomicronomicaron south africa(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

Jury picked for sex trafficking trialPrince Andrew, Queen Elizabeth\u2019s second son, 'a person of interest' in Jeffrey Epstein probe: SourceUK police won't take action against Prince Andrew after Epstein accuser claimed the royal assulted herNEW YORK: The late financier Jeffrey Epstein had \"many, many, many\" female guests at his Palm Beach estate, including two who appeared to be underage, a former employee testified at British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell's sex abuse trial on Thursday.\n\nJuan Alessi, the Palm Beach house manager, took the stand for the prosecution on the fourth day of Maxwell's trial in Manhattan federal court. He said he repeatedly drove two girls who appeared to be 14 or 15 to Epstein's Florida estate.\n\nOne of the girls, now a woman in her early 40s using the pseudonym Jane in court, testified earlier in the week about how Maxwell, a daughter of late media baron Robert Maxwell, groomed her for abuse by Epstein when she was 14.\n\nAlessi, who managed Epstein's Palm Beach property from 1991 to 2002, said Jane appeared to be 14 or 15 when she first came to the house with her mother in 1994. After that, Alessi said he would drive Jane alone to the home, where she spent time with Maxwell and Epstein.\n\nHe said he saw Jane's name in a directory of massage therapists that he would call to schedule massages for Epstein, sometimes at Maxwell's direction. Jane testified that many of her sexual encounters with Epstein would start as massages before escalating.\n\nProsecutor Lara Pomerantz has said massages were a \"ruse designed to get young girls to touch Epstein.\"\n\n\"I had a Rolodex with all the massage therapists,\" Alessi said. \"Whoever they told me to call, I would.\"\n\nHe recalled that when he began working for Epstein the financier would get one massage a day, but years later he would often get three.\n\nProsecutors say Maxwell recruited and groomed underage girls for Epstein to abuse between 1994 and 2004 and participated in some of the sexual encounters.\n\nMaxwell, 59, has pleaded not guilty to eight counts of sex trafficking and other charges.\n\nLawyers for Maxwell say prosecutors are scapegoating her because Epstein is no longer alive.\n\nEpstein killed himself at age 66 in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex abuse charges.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, psychologist Lisa Rocchio testified as an expert witness about how underage victims of sexual abuse are often \"groomed\" by perpetrators they know well, and that many do not disclose abuse until they reach adulthood.\n\n\nKEEPING SECRETSIn eight hours of often emotional, explicit testimony, Jane said she had sexual encounters with Epstein between the ages of 14 and 16 in Palm Beach and at Epstein's ranch in New Mexico. She said Maxwell participated in many of the encounters.\n\nAlessi described Jane as \"strikingly beautiful.\" He said he once drove Jane, who was carrying luggage, from the Palm Beach home to an airport and watched her board a plane with Epstein, Maxwell and Maxwell's dog, a small Yorkie named Max.\n\nMaxwell's lawyers have sought to highlight discrepancies between Jane's testimony and her earlier interviews with law enforcement, when she did not discuss Maxwell's role.\n\nThey contend that the memories of Jane and three other accusers expected to testify against Maxwell have been corrupted over time, and that they have financial incentives to implicate her.\n\nAlessi said he saw topless women hanging out by the pool hundreds of times. Jane also recalled seeing topless women by the pool.\n\nHe said most female guests were in their twenties, but recalled two who appeared to be underage: Jane, and Virginia Roberts, now known as Virginia Giuffre.\n\nGiuffre has said she was a victim of Epstein's sex trafficking and abuse from 2000 to 2002, starting when she was 16.\n\nAlessi recalled driving Maxwell to Mar-a-Lago - former U.S. President Donald Trump's Florida property - to meet Giuffre, and that he sometimes drove her to Epstein's home.\n\nAlessi said he found sex toys in Epstein's massage room four or five times after Epstein received massages.\n\nHe recalled cleaning one of the toys, which he said \"looked like a huge men's penis with two heads,\" and put it in a basket in Maxwell's bathroom. \"That's the place where it was kept,\" Alessi said.\n\nHe also said he was given a booklet of detailed instructions, warning him to keep Epstein's and Maxwell's activities or whereabouts secret.\n\n\"I was supposed to be blind, deaf and dumb,\" Alessi said. \n\nRead More News onJeffrey EpsteinGhislaine MaxwellGhislaine Maxwell sex abuseGhislaine Maxwell trialJeffrey epstein sex abuseDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

The piece focuses one of the most important and iconic moments right before a sporting event or a match - 'a team huddle'. To highlight this universal moment in sports culture, the design includes different hands of both boys and girls, while also incorporating different skin tones and colors to extend the message of equality and highlight the importance of diversity at large. The unique energy that sports and togetherness release for both the players and the public has been captured through the stand-out colors as well as the circular composition to deliver a piece that is palpable in its energy and vibrancy.\n\nThe insightful claim on the turf aims to propagate and bring to life the important and relevant message around teamwork, collaboration, and inclusion. Giulia Ambrogi, Co-founder, St+art India Foundation, says \"We are stoked by the collaboration that brings together art and sport, fuelling the vision of an active lifestyle accessible to all.

Raising the issue during the Zero Hour, he said these online games have now given way to gambling and betting. \n\nRajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu asked Ashwini Vaishnaw, who is Minister of Communications, Electronics & Information Technology, to take note of this issue. \n\n\"Consult the Law Ministry and do the needful. It's a big menace,\" Naidu remarked. \n\nModi said the booming online gaming industry has become a big problem for the youngsters in this country. \n\n\"Online gaming is becoming a big addiction. I would like to highlight that this sector, like the crypto industry, certainly has a regulatory lacunae. So, I would urge the government to bring a uniform tax on online gaming. I urge the government to make a comprehensive framework of regulation for online gaming,\" he said. \n\nIf there are no regulations, Modi said it will be difficult to stop children from getting addicted. \n\n\"Crores and crores of youngsters have become addictive to online gaming. As it is online, it is very difficult to prevent kids from getting addicted. And now this online gaming has been converted into gambling or betting. And now there is a controversy whether it is a game of skill or it is a game of chance,\" the BJP leader said. \n\nDuring the pre-Covid period, the BJP leader said, the weekly time spent on mobile gaming was 2.5 hours, while 11 per cent of total smart phone time was spent on gaming. However, during lockdown, the gaming time has increased to four hours. \n\nThe BJP member said more than 43 crore people are into online gaming currently, and the number is projected to increase to 65.7 crore by 2025.

What provides currency a credence is the fact that it is backed by a sovereign, he said in an interview to ET NOW.\n\nAn important aspect that has to be factored in while talking about a virtual currency is that there is nothing to back the price of a crypto. \"For example, for a stock, the cash flows of that firm is what is actually the backing for that stock. If you take gold, you know it is actually an asset unlike crypto. There is nothing backing crypto and, therefore, intrinsic volatility can be very high, which also impacts the attractiveness of crypto as an asset itself,\" Subramanian said.\nPresented ByDid you Know?Cryptocurrency could buy you a 101-carat diamond at Sotheby\u2019sView Details\u00a0\u00bb\nHistorically, he said, assets have been those that have actually had more stable values and something that has an underlying. \u201cWhenever you take a financial innovation, it is a zero-sum game. In other words, it has no benefits for the real sector or maybe minimal benefit for the real sector. And, thus, it has to be traded very cautiously. Tomorrow, if you and I decide to sit and play cards with each other, what might happen is that money changes hands. Maybe, you might become richer at my expense.

        "Article": "Synopsis\"Investors inevitably end up paying too much for growth and not calculating risks.\"ETMarkets.comIn the Indian context, the first EV adoption will be in the two-wheeler space because the batteries that you need are much smaller and weaker and there is a high amount of consumption there, says Rahul Bhasin, Managing Partner of Baring Private Equity Partners India. Edited excerpts of his interview with ET Now:\n\nWhy are you so excited about the EV space at the current juncture given the valuations of a few global companies and even Tata Motors? This always happens. Investors inevitably end up paying too much for growth and not calculating risks. Everybody is so excited because all EVs use energy. We are just displacing energy and having the power plant consume it. The most efficient internal combustion engine, at present, uses only about 30% of fuel or the energy in actual motion; the rest 70% is lost in heat. EVs, meanwhile, use 96-97% of the energy generated in motion and only 2-3% is lost in heat. Now, this is a step-change in efficiency, and this is such a momentous change that it will drive the entire industry in this direction.\n\nIn the Indian context, the first EV adoption will be in the two-wheeler space because the batteries that you need are much smaller and weaker and there is a high amount of consumption there. Further, the price sensitivity is high. The biggest issue is about charging the batteries but people have found battery swapping solutions. This, I think, is where the market is going to go. A challenge in this space is that geopolitics plays a big role. EVs use lithium-ion batteries. \n\nThe batteries and the motors use magnets, which use neodymium. Both lithium-processing, neodymium-processing are controlled by China. Suddenly, you are changing your dependency from the Gulf states and OPEC to China. That has geopolitical and policy implications. The challenge is how do you get hold of lithium, neodymium, etc. You are not strategically in a weaker spot but there is the issue of cost associated with some of these things.\n\nAnd the third thing is the entire issue of pollution. What happens to the batteries or motors used in EVs at the end of their life? Throw them in landfills and you will get lead poisoning, nickel, mercury, cadmium, a whole bunch of toxic heavy metals which will pollute the environment. So that's not a viable solution and suddenly, the world is figuring out that they need to come out with a solution for that whole space.\n\nThat brings me to another theme of extended product liability, which is getting adopted more in Europe and America but is inevitable in a highly populated country like India. EV adoption will take place, but you will have companies worrying about what to do with the battery at the end-stage simultaneously. Both the themes will throw up opportunity sets that are unique in the Indian context. \n\n\nAnother big theme everyone is talking about is AI. Everything today is associated with it. It reminds me of the movie Matrix, which I saw a couple of years ago. Your thoughts?The impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on our lives today is far more than what any one of us have realised. It is accessing the credit markets in some way or whether it is travel or our consumption habits or on the medical and the health side with different variables.\n\nGoogle mastered this space almost two decades ago. They found ways of adopting a library management system and the ability to search for data and specific kinds of information globally. But now if you look at portals like YouTube, etc, and the amount of video content in the public domain, you look at the content generated for entertainment, education, sports almost a continuous basis or even for security, you will find that there is a tremendous amount of image and video content created but, there is now also a lot of scope of being able to identify sentiment, emotion, intention, aggression all of these kinds of thing through videos and you can identify context when someone should be in a particular place or not.\n\nBut inevitably, to be able to use it and commercialise it, you need entrepreneurs with that kind of foresight and energy. \n\nAI is impacting everything in our lives at a very fundamental level. But a lot of white-collar jobs are going to be impacted severely by AI. People owe it to themselves to learn about AI and its consequences, how they can do their jobs better by using it but also about how to make sure that they are still relevant in the new world because if they do not learn it and they do not learn the consequences, I think it is going to be expensive for them.\n\nThe pace of disruption is so high and has been accelerated by AI at several levels. It is something that any investor needs to go and do a course on AI and learn about it.\n\nPick the best companies to investBECOME AN ETPRIME MEMBERRead More News onevev newsev batteryev market indiaev carsev adoption(What's moving Sensex and  Nifty  Track  latest market news,  stock tips and  expert advice on  ETMarkets.

I have suggested both the Leader of the House and the Leader of Opposition to discuss and ensure smooth functioning of the House.\"\n\nAt this, Goyal posed how can there be a reconciliation when the suspended members are not ready to tender an apology. \"I want to understand from you sir, what does the Opposition expect from us?\" he asked.\n\nClaiming that some members of the opposition parties had approached him on this issue, Goyal told the House, \"I said, I am happy to meet everybody but... a courtesy towards the Chair and nation is an apology. They said we cannot apologize.\"\n\nThe Leader of the House further said that he told the opposition members about past instances where he and the Chair had apologised for very minor issues.\n\n\"They (opposition members) feel what they have done is very legitimate and noble. In these circumstances, what do we talk to the Opposition?\" he said.\n\n\"Some leaders of opposition parties and some suspended MPs have been making provocative\" statements in the last few days. They are saying 'maafi kis baati ki' (What's there to apologise?). This shows they are endorsing the attack on marshals and unruly scenes in the House in the last session,\" he added.\n\nThe 12 opposition MPs were suspended from the Rajya Sabha on Monday for the entire Winter Session of Parliament for their \"unruly\" conduct in the previous session in August. The Opposition has termed the suspension as \"undemocratic and in violation of all the Rules of Procedure\" of the Upper House.\n\nThe suspended MPs include six from the Congress, two each from the Trinamool Congress and Shiv Sena, and one each from the CPI and CPI(M).

Those sanctioned include Sidney Powell, L. Lin Wood and seven other lawyers who were part of the lawsuit filed on behalf of six Republican voters after Joe Biden's 1,54,000-vote victory over Trump. \n\n \"Plaintiffs' attorneys, many of whom seek donations from the public to fund lawsuits like this one ... have the ability to pay this sanction,\" Parker wrote. \n\n She previously ordered each of the lawyers to undergo 12 hours of legal education, including six hours in election law. \n\n Michigan's top three elected officials - Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Attorney General Dana Nessel and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, all Democrats - are seeking the disbarment of four of the nine attorneys, including Powell. She is licensed in Texas. The other three are admitted to practice in Michigan. \n\n Powell could not be reached for comment. Wood said he will appeal the order. \n\n \"I undertook no act in Michigan and I had no involvement in the Michigan lawsuit filed by Sidney Powell,\" he said in an email. Wood's name was on the lawsuit, but he has insisted he had no role other than to tell Powell he would be available if she needed a seasoned litigator. \n\n Powell is best known for saying she would \"release the kraken,\" a mythical sea creature, to destroy Biden's claim on the White House. But baseless lawsuits in Michigan and elsewhere went nowhere, and even the Trump campaign's legal team moved to distance itself from her. \n\n \"There are consequences to filing meritless lawsuits to grab media attention and mislead Americans,\" Benson, the state's chief election official, said in a statement. \"The sanctions awarded in this case are a testament to that, even if the dollar amounts pale in comparison to the damage that's already been done to our nation's democracy.\" (AP) MGA MGA\nRead More News onDonald TrumpDetroitMichiganUS 2020 electionsJoe Biden(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

Didi remains under investigation.\n\n \"Following careful research, the company will immediately start delisting on the New York stock exchange and start preparations for listing in Hong Kong,\" Didi said on its Twitter-like Weibo account.\n\n The company said it would ensure that its New York-listed shares would be convertible into \"freely tradable shares\" on another internationally recognised stock exchange.\n\n It did not explain its reasons for the plan but said in a separate statement that it would organise a shareholder vote at an appropriate time. \n\n The upending of Didi's New York listing - likely to be a difficult and messy process - illustrates both the huge clout that Chinese regulators possess and their emboldened approach to wielding it. Billionaire Jack Ma also ran afoul of Chinese authorities, leading to the dramatic scuppering of a mega-IPO for Ant Group last year.\n\n The move will also likely further discourage Chinese firms from listing in the United States and could prompt some to reconsider their status as U.S. publicly traded companies.\n\n \"Chinese ADRs face increasing regulatory challenges from both U.S. and Chinese authorities. For most companies, it will be like walking on eggshells trying to please both sides. Delisting will only make things simpler,\" said Wang Qi, CEO at fund manager at MegaTrust Investment (HK).\n\n Sources have told Reuters that Chinese regulators pressed Didi's top executives to devise a plan to delist from the New York Stock Exchange due to concerns about data security.\n\n Didi is planning to proceed with a Hong Kong listing soon before embarking on a delisting from New York, sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n\n It aims to complete a dual primary listing in Hong Kong in the next three months, and under pressure from Beijing delist from New York by June 2022, said one of the sources.\n\n The sources were not authorised to talk to media and declined to be identified. Didi did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.\n\n Listing in Hong Kong might, however, prove complicated.\n\n One key challenge is whether the bourse would willing to approve it given that only 20%-30% of the company's core ride-hailing business in China is fully compliant with regulations requiring three permits, a source with knowledge of the matter said on Friday.\n\n The source, who was not authorised to talk to media and declined to be identified, added that this had been the main obstacle to the company conducting an IPO in Hong Kong earlier.\n\n Didi did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.\n\n Sources have also told Reuters that Didi is preparing to relaunch its apps in China by the end of the year in anticipation that Beijing's cybersecurity investigation into the company would be wrapped up by then.\n\n The CAC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Didi's plans to delist from New York.\n\n Didi made its New York debut on June 30 at $14 per American Depositary Share, which gave the company a valuation of $67.5 billion on a non-diluted basis. Those shares have since slid 44% until Thursday's close, valuing it at $37.6 billion.\n\n Shares in Didi investor SoftBank Group Corp fell 2% after the Didi announcement, also hurt by Southeast Asian ridehailing giant Grab's slump in its Nasdaq debut.\n\n SoftBank's Vision Fund owns 21.5% of Didi, followed by Uber Technologies Inc with 12.8%, according to a filing in June by Didi.\n\nPick the best companies to investBECOME AN ETPRIME MEMBERRead More News onDidiDidi Globaldidi global incDidi Global newsDidi Global listing(What's moving Sensex and  Nifty  Track  latest market news,  stock tips and  expert advice on  ETMarkets.

        "Article": "SynopsisTechnology does have a role to play in making learning more self-paced and immersive. There is a big difference between blended learning and the hybrid delivery model.ET SpotlightRahul Dasgupta, Director, GBSA continuous innovation in management education that started in 2002 sets foot in its 21st year in 2022. Having taken 3000+ ambitious youngsters to the next level of their professional careers, Globsyn Business School \u2013 the No. 1 Private B-School in Kolkata \u2013 is about to complete 20 years of existence.\n\nFounded by Mr Bikram Dasgupta, a doyen of the Indian IT industry, operated by the Dasgupta Family, and steered by the Legacy Team, GBS (as it is lovingly called by its alumni) is not only known for its industry connects but is also a front runner when it comes to amalgamating technology and innovative pedagogy with management education to maximize the learnings of its students.\n\nET SpotlightRahul Dasgupta, Director, GBS, engaging with an audience in a GBS Hybrid Learning ClassroomIn a rendezvous with Mr Rahul Dasgupta, Director, Globsyn Business School, we talked about the illustrious journey so far and the future for GBS.\n\n\nHow do you see the last 20 years of Globsyn Business School?\nFor our family, it has been an incredible and fulfilling journey of two decades. Building a globally relevant and sustainable brand in the education sector from the ground up while staying true to its legacy is no easy task. Globsyn Business School was founded by my father, he was was one of the pioneers of the Indian IT industry and an entrepreneur of global repute, with the vision of setting up India\u2019s First Corporate B-School in 2002.\n\nNaturally, this two-decade-long journey has seen its fair share of opportunities and challenges for us. Over the last 20 years, one of the things that we have heavily focussed on is our emphasis on technology to enhance the academic experience. That has been our most significant differentiator. As a postgraduate management institute, we are way ahead of the curve compared to the market regarding the use of technology in academic delivery. We do so by adopting technology across every vertical of the organization \u2013 academic delivery, business development, research and innovation, industry and academic collaborations, or placements. In the next 3 to 5 years, we are looking to enhance our investment in technology to improve the learning outcome amongst our students and be at par with institutes of global repute.\n\n\nWhen you say \u2018technology\u2019, does that mean GBS will move towards building a virtual learning ecosystem like the \u2018Metaverse\u2019?\n\u2018Metaverse\u2019 has become the top trending word globally. I think \u2018Metaverse\u2019 is a far-fetched idea, but not an impossible one for the future. There are various steps an institution must take early on to build a seamless virtual learning environment before it becomes a part of the \u2018Metaverse\u2019. For us at GBS, we are definitely looking at incorporating more technology in our hybrid delivery model. We started with integrating Blockchain in our certification process 3 years ago. We are now looking at other technologies, like 3D Videos, Mixed Reality (MR) and Augmented Reality (AR), to enhance the learning experience of a student in the next 3 to 5 years.\n\nET SpotlightAugmented Reality enabled Education\nHow will AR and VR work in the Hybrid Delivery Model at GBS?Every sector, education included, will get disrupted in some way or the other using reality technologies. It will be interesting to see how organizations across the globe harness the power of these technologies to provide their stakeholders \u2013 universities and colleges \u2013 with immersive technologies that enhance learning experiences. At GBS, our plan is to use AR and MR to bridge the gap in experiential learning to a great extent in our Hybrid Delivery Model. We have already started investing in some of these technologies to figure out how we can do this. I see this getting wholly integrated into our pedagogy over the coming years.\n\n\nDue to the Pandemic, all sectors, including education, had to go through an offline to online transition process. Do you think that this will be an effective way of learning in the future?In my opinion, nothing can replace campus learning. When students interact with their peers and faculty members, participate in various extracurricular programs, and sit in a physical classroom, they constantly learn through humane engagements. This connection cannot be replaced by technology. However, technology does have a role to play in making learning more self-paced and immersive. There is a big difference between blended learning and the hybrid delivery model. The latter is more learner-centric and focuses on how each individual student learns.\n\nET SpotlightA few Beyond Education activities of Globsyn Business School\nHow does GBS look at integrating what it teaches beyond its classrooms in a hybrid delivery model?Not everything can be taught virtually. At GBS, while \u2018knowing\u2019 skills are imparted through a structured pedagogy, \u2018doing\u2019 and \u2018being\u2019 skills are propagated through its \u2018Beyond Education\u2019 activities. All these are carried on both in the virtual and physical environments. Some of the activities like our leadership program, which is imparted through our \u2018Care for Society\u2019 initiative, requires our students to be physically engaged. Whereas certain other activities that were earlier done in the physical world have now all migrated virtually.\n\nWith businesses rapidly shifting their operations online, it has become necessary today for institutions to train their students to operate in both physical and virtual worlds. This is also a recommendation given to us by many corporates, who come to recruit our students. Our mission has always been to provide our young managers with the best and most relevant academic and experiential learning environment so that they are ready to take on the challenges of the corporate world from the day they graduate.\n\n\nHow do you evaluate the learning outcome of the students in this augmented world?The way a student gets assessed needs to change in India. We focus too much on the knowledge outcomes instead of evaluating students' cognitive and conative thinking and problem-solving skills. At GBS, we are researching different assessment techniques, which evaluates the ability of a learner to be agile, work collaboratively with their peers, and solve real-life problems. We feel that institutions in India need to create more responsible thinkers than followers. One of the ways we are looking to evaluate our students in this augmented world is by building problem scenarios and allowing them to solve those through gamification as part of their ongoing assessments.\n\n\nDo you think the hybrid delivery model will make a student more relevant for tomorrow?The science of Andragogy focuses on \u2018intention\u2019 as its core principle, when it comes to adult learning.. At GBS, we believe that giving students an academic environment where they can choose to learn the way they want to would allow them to become more involved, engaged, and experienced. This will also enable our students to make better career choices and help our corporate partners get skilled resources who are trained to operate in the \u2018New Normal\u2019.\n\nWe have over 100 corporates visiting our B-School at various capacities around the year. Our Hybrid Delivery Model allows the students to engage with the corporates for multiple activities during their time at the B-School. This makes them relevant for the industry early on.\n\nET SpotlightGlobsyn Business School completes 20 years in Postgraduate Management Education\nHow long will GBS take to implement this?Any such disruption takes time and sizeable investment. We are looking to transform our pedagogy over the next 3 to 5 years. We have already set out on our implementation plan \u2013 the first step will be to align our resources and processes with these future initiatives. We are also looking at acquiring certain technologies that will speed up this process. Our intention is to build a meta and a physical world for our learners, which would enhance the learning outcome of our students. We would like to study how some of these reality technologies evolve over time and their adoption by the corporate world. But one thing is for sure, regardless of the kind of technology we integrate into our pedagogy, the touch and feel of the physical classroom experience will never go away.\n\n\n\t            (This article is generated and published by ET Spotlight team.

AgenciesThe Supreme Court Friday refused to entertain the bail plea filed on health grounds by jailed businessman Rakesh Wadhawan, accused of money laundering in the multi-crore rupees Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative (PMC) Bank fraud case, saying that he has been in hospital more than the jail. A bench comprising Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli permitted senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Wadhawan, to withdraw the bail plea to approach the high court. \n\n Rohatgi referred to the medical condition of the accused and said that he has been in jail for quite some time. \n\n \"I see, he has been in hospital more than in jail. Go to the high court,\" the bench said prompting Rohatgi to say that it was the high court which refused the bail. \n\n \"File after some time. Not now. Alright permitted to withdraw to approach the high court,\" the bench said. \n\n The Bombay High Court on October 14 had refused to grant bail to Wadhawan. \n\n Wadhawan, founder of Housing Development Infrastructure Limited (HDIL), was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in 2019 in the case. \n\n The high court had said that Wadhawan's submission that he was immediately required to be released on temporary bail on medical grounds, was \"not justified\". \n\n It had said that denial of medical bail was in no way a breach of Wadhawan's fundamental right to life since he had been provided adequate medical treatment by the state prison authorities whenever required. \n\n Wadhawan, who had undergone a surgery for pacemaker implantation, had sought that he be released on bail so that he can seek discharge from the civic-run KEM Hospital in the city, where he is recuperating while in judicial custody, and shift to a private hospital while out on bail. \n\n He had said in his plea that he suffered from severe comorbidities, that his immune system had been compromised after having contracted COVID-19 recently, and that he was susceptible to contracting infections and ailments while at the civic hospital due to the heavy footfall the hospital received. \n\n He had also said that the KEM Hospital did not have an ICU facility specifically meant for those suffering from cardiac issues. \n\nThe fraud at PMC Bank came to light in September 2019 after the Reserve Bank of India discovered that the bank had allegedly created fictitious accounts to hide over Rs 4,355 crore of loans extended to almost-bankrupt Housing Development and Infrastructure Limited (HDIL). \n\n According to RBI, the PMC bank masked 44 problematic loan accounts, including those of HDIL, by tampering with its core banking system, and the accounts were accessible only to limited staff members. \n\n Mumbai Police's Economic Offences Wing and the ED had registered offences against senior bank officials and HDIL promoters.\nRead More News onPMC BankSCHCRakesh WadhawanHDIL(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

It says the move may hurt its revenue.\n\n July 5-6 - Didi says it was unaware before its IPO that the CAC would launch a cybersecurity investigation or order a halt in China to new user registrations and a suspension of app downloads.\n\n Didi shares fall as much as 25% in the first U.S. trading session since Chinese regulators ordered its app off mobile app stores in China.\n\n July 8 - Medical data group LinkDoc Technology becomes the first Chinese company to pull back from plans to list in the United States after regulators started an investigation into Didi.\n\n July 30 - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission says it will not allow Chinese companies to raise money in the United States unless they fully explain their legal structures and disclose the risk of Beijing interfering in their businesses.\n\n Aug 10 - SoftBank says it will pause its investing in China as it waits for regulatory action against the country's tech firms to play out.\n\n Aug 11 - Autonomous driving startup Pony.ai suspends its plan to go public in New York through a merger with a blank-check firm at a $12 billion valuation, after it failed to gain assurances from Beijing that it would not become a target of a crackdown against Chinese technology companies, people familiar with the matter say.\n\n Aug 27 - China is framing rules to ban internet companies whose data poses potential security risks from listing outside the country, including in the United States, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\n Sept 2 - Chinese regulators summon 11 ride-hailing firms including Didi, Geely's Caocao and Meituan's ride-hailing unit to discuss points of concern.\n\n Sept 3 - The city of Beijing is considering taking Didi under state control, Bloomberg News reports.\n\n Sept 4 - Didi denied reports that the Beijing city government is coordinating companies to invest in it.\n\n Sept 7 - Beijing city government told Reuters in a faxed statement it was not advising companies to invest in Didi.\n\n Sept 8 - China's Ministry of Transport said it would crack down on illegal behaviour in the country's ride-hailing industry.\n\n Sept 10 - Chinese government officials told leading delivery and ride-hailing companies including Didi, Meituan, Alibaba Group's Ele.me and Tencent Holdings, to improve how they distributed incomes and ensure rest periods for workers.\n\n Sept 20 - Didi co-founder and President Jean Liu has told some close associates that she intends to step down, Reuters reported.\n\n Sept 30 - China published new draft measures aimed at bolstering its new data security law, including definitions of what it considered \"core\" and \"important\" data.\n\n Oct 21 - China's cybersecurity watchdog suggested Didi and two other U.S.-listed tech companies explore listings in Hong Kong, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\n Oct 29 - CAC published draft guidelines that will subject companies with more than 1 million users in the country to a security review before they can send user-related data abroad.\n\n Nov 8 - SoftBank Group Corp valued its Didi stake at $7.5 billion, 40% below acquisition cost.\n\n Nov 11 - Didi was preparing to relaunch its ride-hailing and other apps in China by the end of the year in anticipation that Beijing's investigation into the company will be wrapped up by then, Reuters reported.\n\n Nov 14 - CAC published draft rules that would require companies pursuing share listings in Hong Kong to apply for cybersecurity inspections if they handle data that concerns national security. Large internet platforms planning to set up headquarters, operating or research centres abroad should also submit a report to regulators, CAC said.\n\n Nov 26 - Chinese regulators have pressed top executives of Didi to devise a plan to delist from the New York Stock Exchange due to concerns about data security, sources said.\n\n Dec 3 - Didi announced plan to delist from New York and seek a Hong Kong listing.\n\nPick the best companies to investBECOME AN ETPRIME MEMBERRead More News onDidi delistingdidiDidi stock newsDidi US delistingDidi Global news(What's moving Sensex and  Nifty  Track  latest market news,  stock tips and  expert advice on  ETMarkets.

Edited excerpts from a chat with ET Now:\n\n\nMutual funds, HNIs, DIIs and FIIs all gave Star Health IPO a miss but the retail portion got oversubscribed. What is that telling you about the retail frenzy out there? It is very tough for them (retail investors) to evaluate the valuation of companies in a manner where they can take a decision based properly on fundamentals. That requires a much more in-depth research. So to that extent, I would think that the extent of oversubscription in Star Health is quite low and that actually reflects maturity. On social media, everyone is reading about what is happening, the losses some people made in previous IPOs and decided not to go in for high-priced IPO at this stage. I would not take it negatively. I would think that the degree of oversubscription is low. It is positive because it reflects the ebbing of the frenzy which peaked out over the last 2-3 IPOs. It has become selective now. There is another IPO of Tega Industries where people saw that valuations may be more reasonable. It is getting subscribed.\n\n\nWhat are you making of all the chatter coming in from the auto majors? We were just chatting with Maruti management the other day and the situation seems pretty grim when it comes to the semiconductor chip shortage and commodity prices. There is only a limited price hike that they will be able to undertake before it starts hitting their volumes. Two-wheeler segment would be under stress, given the employment situation and high prices. Fuel prices are still high even after the recent cuts. So that is where pressures would remain. Maruti has come into a trading zone. When it falls below Rs 7,000, valuation becomes reasonable and then it rallies 10-15%. That could continue for some time before their shortage issues get resolved. In four-wheelers, especially cars, the demand situation is not as bleak as that in two-wheelers. It is more for many of the top selling models and related to supply constraints.\n\n\nPick the best companies to investBECOME AN ETPRIME MEMBERRead More News onipoipo newsipo market indiastar health ipostar healthipo indiaipos in india(What's moving Sensex and  Nifty  Track  latest market news,  stock tips and  expert advice on  ETMarkets.

They also liberalise norms for enhancing trade in services and boost investments in a CECA. \n\n \"The main purpose of this visit is to try to ensure that we get the best possible trade deal between India and Australia as quickly as possible... \n\n \"Based on the discussions last night with (Commerce and Industry) Minister Piyush Goyal and senior members of his team, I am confident that we can do a very good early harvest deal, which is larger rather than smaller, by the end of the year or very early in the new year...,\" Abbott told reporters. \n\n \"I am certainly confident, based on the discussions we had last night, that the time table will be met,\" he said. \n\n Both the countries launched negotiations for a CECA in May 2011, but the negotiations were suspended in 2015, due to certain disagreements over issues such as market access in agriculture and dairy products, which Canberra had sought and over New Delhi's demand of visa liberalisation for professionals. \n\n When asked about India's sensitivities in the agriculture sector, Abbott said that \"Australia accepts that because of the particular nature of Indian agriculture, there are very much small family farms, as opposed to the much larger commercial operations in Australia, we absolutely accept that there are some important sensitivities in Indian agriculture\". \n\n There has to be some carve outs for elements of Indian agriculture in a good and fair trade deal, he added. \n\n \"I am confident that we can make strong progress and one of the areas where we can make a strong progress even in the early harvest agreement is wine... I am hoping that more and more people in India will have an affordable opportunity to experience this great Australian product in the months and years ahead,\" he said. \n\n On the issue of smooth movement of professionals also, he expressed confidence that \"as part of this deal we will have enhanced mobility\" between the two countries. \n\n He added that dairy is also one of the sensitive areas. \n\n \"The point I want to stress is that Australia is not a predatory trader, we are free and fair traders and our objective here is not to disrupt, our objective here is to partner,\" he said. \n\n The principal exports of Australia to India include coal and these goods are key for Make in India. \n\n Further, he said that many countries have trade tensions with China and this is an interesting moment for India as several nations are looking for a substitute for China in supply chains and India is the obvious alternative \"because almost no country has India's capability to manufacture economically and at scale\". \n\n In 2020-21, India's exports to Australia were USD 4.04 billion, while imports were USD 8.24 billion. \n\n India mainly exported refined petroleum, medicaments, railway vehicles including hovertrains, pearls and gems, jewellery, and made-up textile articles. While imports include coal, copper ores and concentrates, gold, vegetables, wool, fruits and nuts, lentils, and education-related services. \n\n \"Met with @HonTonyAbbott, Special Trade Envoy of the Prime Minister of Australia.

UIDAI CEO Saurabh Garg during a panel discussion with Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma at the Infinity Forum said the authority is also exploring emerging technology to enhance security and increase the number of transactions that can be done by using Aadhaar. \n\n \"We think going forward we will be happy to collaborate with other nations...We would like to collaborate with international organisations also in building international institutions for standards for national identity. We look forward to future years to collaborate with different nations and see that digital identity, which becomes a means of empowerment, is available across the world,\" Garg said. \n\n He said 99.5 per cent of the population in India now has Aadhaar and 50 million authentication is done on a daily basis for verifying various transactions. \n\n Garg in a different event on Thursday had said UIDAI is working with the World Bank and the United Nations to replicate the Aadhaar architecture in other countries. \n\n When asked about technology work at UIDAI, Garg in the Infinity Forum event said, \"We want to look at quantum computing on how to strengthen security, blockchain and we are also looking at artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning(ML).\" \n\n He said UIDAI wants to use AI and ML in the verification of documents and the ultimate goal of the organisation is to enable people to carry out a larger number of transactions using the Aadhaar platform. \n\n Sharma acknowledged that Paytm and Paytm Bank have been one of the biggest beneficiaries of Aadhaar technology in customer boarding. \n\n \"Overall, fintech industry of India is sort of based on the Aadhaar ecosystem that the UIDAI team has built up. I want to share the technology scale that is typically not seen with government organisations. I want to acknowledge that these are the best APIs (application programming interface) that we have in this country for throughput and scale,\" Sharma said.\nRead More News onaadhaaruidaiunited nationsworld bankpaytminfinity forumVijay Shekhar SharmaSaurabh Garg(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

Forty such squads would monitor the implementation of measures suggested by it to deal with pollution, the panel said. \n\nSeventeen such flying squads have been constituted to ensure the implementation of various measures mandated by the court and the panel. The number would be raised to 40 within 24 hours, the affidavit said, \n\nBan on entry of trucks, excluding those carrying essential goods and those running on cleaner fuel, will continue, it said \n\nTaking a note of the measures, the bench ordered, \"We have perused affidavit by Centre and the Delhi government. We have taken into consideration the directions proposed. We direct the Centre and the government of National Capital Territory to implement the orders of December 2 and we keep the matter pending and will hear it on next Friday\". \n\n At the outset, the bench referred to certain news reports and said a message \"intentionally or unintentionally\" been sent that the court is the \"villain\" and it is ordering the closure of schools. \n\n\"One thing which we observed is whether intentional or unintentional and some sections of media portrays us that we are the villains who want to close down the schools. You (Delhi government) on your own opened the schools. But, see the newspapers..,\" the chief justice said. \n\nSenior advocate A M Singhvi, appearing for the Delhi government, referred to a news report and said that one English newspaper reported that the apex court threatened to take over the administration. \n\n\"You (Delhi government) can condemn all of this but where do we go? Where did we say that we will take up an administrative role... We cannot interfere with the freedom of speech and expression and a political party can hold a press conference but we cannot do so,\" the bench said. \n\nSolicitor General Tushar Mehta, in a lighter vein, quoted Mark Twain: \"If you do not read newspapers you are uninformed and if you read them then you are ill-informed.\" \n\nThe bench said the issue of rise in pollution was not adversarial litigation and it will keep monitoring the solution. \n\nIt asked the Uttar Pradesh government to approach the commission on air quality management with its grievance against the direction that the industries, which was not running on cleaner fuel in NCR, will be allowed to operate for eight hours a day only. \n\nSenior advocate Ranjit Kumar, appearing for Uttar Pradesh, said sugarcane crushing goes on continuously in this season and the direction will harm farmers. \n\nThe apex court, on Thursday, said nothing was happening on ground to control the deteriorating air quality in Delhi-NCR and directed the Centre and Delhi government to come out with suggestions to control the pollution within 24 hours. \n\nIt was hearing a plea filed by environmental activist Aditya Dubey and law student Aman Banka, who sought directions to provide stubble-removing machines to small and marginal farmers for free.\nRead More News ondelhiuttarsupreme courtdelhi air pollutionair pollution(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

The Covid-19 pandemic and travel restrictions caused a further drop in international demand for Indian services.\n\nA reading above 50 on the index indicates expansion while below that shows contraction.\n\nAs per the survey report, although business confidence improved to a three- month high in November, the overall level of positive sentiment was well below its long-run average. Some companies expect demand to continue to trend higher, but several others were worried that elevated inflation could dampen the recovery, it said. \n\nMoreover, the overall rate of inflation quickened from October and was the second-strongest in almost a decade, behind April.\n\n\u201cThe recovery of the Indian service sector was extended to November, with a robust improvement in sales enabling the second-fastest rise in business activity in nearly ten-and-a-half years,\u201d said Pollyanna De Lima, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit, adding that companies were somewhat convinced that output levels would continue to increase in the year ahead, but worries regarding inflationary pressures weighed on confidence again.\n\nA sister survey earlier this week showed manufacturing activity in India grew at its fastest pace in 10 months in November.\n\nThe Composite PMI Output Index signalled the strongest upturn since January 2012 and rose to 59.2 in November from 58.7 in October.\n\n\u201cLooking at the manufacturing and service sectors combined, the results are even more encouraging and bode well for economic performance in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022 so far,\u201d said De Lima.\n\nPrivate sector employment increased only slightly in November.\n\nRead More News onservices activityNovember services PMINov services activityihs markitIndian servicesprivate sector activity(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin said the 19-year-old female transited in Singapore and arrived in Malaysia on Nov 19, where she underwent a COVID-19 test upon arrival. She was then bussed to her university lodging in northern Perak state with four others and placed under quarantine, he said. \n\n Results the next day confirmed the student was positive for COVID-19, he said. The bus driver and four others in the vehicle tested negative and were all quarantined, he added. \n\n Khairy noted that the student arrived in Malaysia before South Africa reported its first omicron case to the World Health Organisation. \n\n Following the discovery of the omicron strain, the ministry conducted genomic tests on 74 positive samples at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport between November 11 and 28 to detect the variant, Khairy said. Tests confirmed Thursday the student, who has since been released from a 10-day quarantine, had the omicron strain, he said. \n\n \"What is important is the individual fully complied with home quarantine... is fully vaccinated and was asymptomatic. We have done both automated and manual contact tracing and so far this case is contained,\" Khairy tweeted. \n\n Malaysia, like many other countries, has tightened restrictions following the discovery of the new variant. It has banned visitors from eight African nations and requires travelers flying in from high-risk countries to wear a digital tracker device throughout their quarantine. \n\n Much remains unknown about the new variant, including whether it is more contagious, as some health authorities suspect, whether it makes people more seriously ill, and whether it can thwart vaccines.\nRead More News onomicronmalaysiakhairyworld health organisationsouth africasingaporeperak(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

However, he added that he did not feel 'guilt'.Pic: ABC News YouTubeLOS ANGELES: Alec Baldwin said he does not feel guilty for the death of Halyna Hutchins on the set of \"Rust,\" as he explained that he started cocking the gun that killed the cinematographer but did not pull the trigger.\n\n \"I feel that someone is responsible for what happened and I can't say who that is. But I know it's not me,\" the US actor told ABC in his first major interview since the on-set tragedy in New Mexico in October.\n\n \"I mean, I honest to God, if I felt that I was responsible, I might have killed myself,\" he said in the interview broadcast Thursday.\n\n Baldwin was rehearsing a scene on the low-budget Western when the Colt .45 he was brandishing discharged a live round that struck Hutchins and director Joel Souza, who survived. \n\n The former \"30 Rock\" star said the criminal investigation should focus on discovering who had brought live rounds onto the set of \"Rust.\" \n\n \"I don't have anything to hide,\" he said.\n\n Describing the incident in detail, Baldwin said he had been told the gun was \"cold\" - industry lingo for a firearm containing no live ammunition - and had been instructed by Hutchins to point the gun in her direction as she prepared to film the scene.\n\nAPThis image released by ABC News shows actor-producer Alec Baldwin, left, during an interview with 'Good Morning America' co-anchor George Stephanopoulos.

They don't have their earplugs in... the gun was supposed to be empty. I was told I was handed an empty gun.\"\n\n Baldwin said he initially thought Hutchins may have fainted or had a heart attack, and was only told she had been killed with a live round hours later following a lengthy police interview. \n\n He dismissed suggestions that live rounds may have been introduced on set as an act of sabotage, saying it was \"overwhelmingly likely that it was an accident.\"\n\n Baldwin, along with other people working on \"Rust,\" is facing two civil lawsuits, while prosecutors have refused to rule out criminal charges.\n\n He said he would be \"stunned\" if Hutchins' husband did not also file a lawsuit against producers, including himself.\n\n The tragedy has sent shockwaves through Hollywood, and led to calls for guns to be permanently banned from sets.\n\n Baldwin said he had been called a \"murderer\" since the incident, but disputed claims from some critics that it was an actor's responsibility to check weapons.\n\n But, he said, the tragedy had changed things for him. \n\n \"I can't imagine I'd ever do a movie that had a gun in it again,\" said Baldwin.\n\n\n\nRead More News onAlec Baldwincinematographer Halyna HutchinsHalyna HutchinsRustRust setRust ShootingDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

        "Article": "SynopsisTwo of the four people with knowledge of the matter described the car as an electric holy grail for Toyota which has struggled for years to come up with a small EV that is both competitive on cost in China and doesn't compromise on comfort.APToyota Motor Corp will launch an all-electric small sedan in China late next year, having turned to local partner BYD for key technology to finally make an affordable yet roomy runaround, four sources said.\n\n Two of the four people with knowledge of the matter described the car as an electric holy grail for Toyota which has struggled for years to come up with a small EV that is both competitive on cost in China and doesn't compromise on comfort.\n\n The sources said the breakthrough was chiefly down to BYD's less bulky lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) Blade batteries and its lower-cost engineering know-how - a turning of the tables for a Chinese company whose popular F3 saloon was inspired by Toyota's Corolla back in 2005.\n\n Little known outside China at the time, BYD, or \"Build Your Dreams\", hit the headlines in 2008 when Warren Buffett bought a 10% stake and it has since become one of the biggest manufacturers of so-called new energy vehicles in the world.\n\n Toyota's new EV will be slightly bigger than its compact Corolla, the world's best-selling car of all time. One source said think of it as \"a Corolla with bigger back-seat section\".\n\n It will be unveiled as a concept car at the Beijing auto show in April and will then most likely be launched as the second model in Toyota's new bZ series of all-electric cars, even though it will only be on sale in China for now.\n\n \"The car was enabled by BYD battery technology,\" one of the sources told Reuters. \"It has more or less helped us resolve challenges we had faced in coming up with an affordable small electric sedan with a roomy interior.\" \n\n It will be pitched below premium EVs such as Tesla's Model Y or the Nio ES6 but above the ultra-cheap Hong Guang Mini EV, which starts at just $4,500 and is now China's best-selling electric vehicle.\n\n Two of the four sources, all of whom declined to be named because they are not authorised to speak to the media, said the new Toyota would be priced competitively. \n\n One said it would likely sell for under 200,000 yuan ($30,000), aiming for a segment of the Chinese market Tesla is expected to target with a small car within the next two years.\n\n \"We don't comment on future products,\" a Toyota spokesperson said. \"Toyota considers battery electric vehicles as one path to help us get to carbon neutrality and is engaged in the development of all types of electrified vehicle solutions.\"\n\n A BYD spokesperson declined to comment.\n\n\n'ALL KINDA FLOORED'\nThe fact Toyota has been compelled to turn to BYD to solve its low-cost EV conundrum shows how far the competitive balance of the global auto industry has tipped in the past decade.\n\n When the quality of Chinese vehicles was considered below par, global automakers were not too concerned that they couldn't compete on price and left Chinese companies to control the domestic market for cheap, no-frills cars.\n\n But times have changed.\n\n Toyota executives started to worry back in 2015 when BYD launched its Tang plug-in hybrid, with significant improvements in styling, quality and performance. Most worrying was that fact it was still about 30% cheaper than comparable Toyota models.\n\n There was a critical turn of events in 2017 when Toyota's top engineering leaders, including then-executive vice president Shigeki Terashi, drove several BYD cars such as the Tang at its proving ground in Toyota City near its headquarters in Japan.\n\n Terashi subsequently visited BYD's headquarters in Shenzhen and drove a prototype of its Han electric car. \n\n \"Their long-term quality is still a question mark, but the design and quality of these cars showed levels of maturity, yet they were much cheaper than comparable Toyota models,\" said one of the four sources, who participated in the test drives. \n\n \"We were all kinda floored by that.\"\n\n Two of the sources said the BYD evaluations pushed Toyota to create its research and development (R&D) joint venture with BYD last year. Toyota now has two dozen engineers in Shenzhen working side-by-side with about 100 BYD counterparts.\n\n\nBLADE WINNER\nToyota's new EV comes at a time it is under fire from environmental groups that maintain it is not committed to zero emissions. They say Toyota is more interested in prolonging the commercial usefulness of its successful hybrid technology. \n\n Toyota executives say they're not against battery electric vehicles (BEVs) but argue that until renewable energy becomes more widely available, they won't be a silver bullet for slashing carbon emissions.\n\n Nevertheless, Toyota has set up division in Japan dedicated to zero-emissions cars called ZEV Factory and it is developing safer and lower-cost battery technologies, including solid-state lithium-ion cells which would significantly boost an EV's range. \n\n While Toyota has long advocated a runaround that doesn't compromise on comfort as the best way to popularise BEVs, it has struggled to produce such a car.\n\n One problem stems from need to stack bulky, heavy batteries under the floor, as they eat up the interior unless the roof is raised too - which is why many smaller EVs are SUVs.\n\n In 2018, Toyota briefly explored the idea of a battery venture with BYD. That and subsequent interactions led Toyota's engineers to come across BYD's LFP Blade battery. They described it as a game-changer as it was both cheaper and freed up space.\n\n \"It's a 'scales fell from my eyes' kind of technology we initially dismissed because its design is so radically simple,\" one of the four sources said.\n\n BYD officially launched its Blade battery in 2020.\n\n LFP batteries have a lower energy density than most other lithium-ion cells but are cheaper, have a longer shelf-life, are less prone to overheating and don't use cobalt or nickel. Tesla already uses LFP batteries in its Model 3 and Model Y in China.\n\n One of the sources said a typical Blade pack is about 10 cm (3.9 inches) thick when the modules are laid flat on the floor, roughly 5 cm to 10 cm thinner than other lithium-ion packs.\n\n A BYD spokesperson said that was possible, depending on how an automaker packages the Blade pack in a car.\n\n\nCUTTING CORNERS?\nWhile Toyota has not fully solved the puzzle as to how BYD keeps coming in low on costs, two of the sources said one factor may be its abbreviated and flexible design and quality assurance process - which some Toyota engineers see as cutting corners.\n\n Toyota's planning process is much more rigid and thorough, the sources said. Once it has decided on the technologies, components and systems at the outset of a car's three-to-four-year development process, it rarely changes designs. \n\n During the process, Toyota typically does three design prototypes and three manufacturing prototypes. Some are driven about 150,000 km (93,000 miles) to bullet-proof quality and reliability when testing for emissions or bad-road durability.\n\n At BYD, engineers do far less prototyping - there are typically just two - and designs can be changed as late as two years into the process, which is a definite no-no at Toyota, one source said. A BYD spokesperson declined to comment.\n\n But as a result of those last-minute changes, the technology in a BYD car is much more up to date than in a Toyota when it hits the market, and is often cheaper.\n\n The four sources believe that further advances in simulation and virtual engineering know-how, as well as the fact that BYD produces a wide array of its own components, have helped it close potential gaps in quality and reliability that could stem from such last-minute design changes. \n\n \"Our challenge at Toyota is whether we dismiss BYD's way of engineering as being loosey-goosey and too risky, or whether we can learn from it,\" one of the sources said.\n\nRead More News onToyotaelectric holy grailBYDEV(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

We think it's important to move some China legislation, hopefully much of it focused on human rights. The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act we want to see that get over the finish line in some form.\"\n\n President Joe Biden is hosting a summit of democracies next week, seen as an effort to push back against China's growing influence.\n\n Republicans and Democrats have been arguing over the Uyghur legislation for months. Most recently, Republican Senator Marco Rubio has been demanding that the measure be included as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, delaying the Senate's consideration of the massive annual bill setting policy for the Pentagon.\n\n Rubio's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether House passage of McGovern's bill would change his stance on the defense bill.\n\n If the Uyghur measure becomes law, it would create a \"rebuttable presumption\" that all goods from Xinjiang, where the Chinese government has set up a vast network of detention camps for Uyghurs and other Muslim groups, were made with forced labor.\n\n China denies abuses in Xinjiang, which supplies much of the world's materials for solar panels, but the U.S. government and many rights groups say Beijing is carrying out genocide there.\n\n Republicans have accused Biden's Democrats of slow-walking the legislation because it would complicate the president's renewable energy agenda. Democrats deny that.\n\n \"I just want to see a strong, a much stronger, approach when it comes to forced labor in Xinjiang,\" Democratic Representative Dan Kildee told Reuters in a telephone interview, arguing that domestic production of solar panels could be ramped up.\n\n\nRead More News onxinjiangchinauyghursuyghur forced labor prevention actBidenXI Jinping(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

Edited excerpts:\n\nAre we in for a tough December as volatility is back?Historically, Decembers are mild months or good months for the market. So either the market moves up or falls mildly in December. We never get a big selloff in December. So I do not think that the trend could change now. But directionally in the longer term, 2022 might be tough for the market as money making was easy this year. It might not be easy next year because of the various headwinds related to potentially higher interest rates and potentially slowing economy globally after the big spurt. Valuations, specifically in India, are no longer as compelling as they were a year ago.\n\n\nIs it a good time to start nibbling, if not buying?There are companies that are doing well, have corrected and will potentially do very well going forward. So keep a look out on increasing your exposure in places where most of the funds have low exposure -- capital goods, infrastructure, construction, etc. Many companies have got large order books, executions have picked up, margins are picking up because of operating leverage and hopefully we will not get shutdowns again because of the new variant.\n\nStock Analysis \u2013 Know before investing\n                            Stock score of  Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd  moved down by 1 in a week on a 10-point scale.\n                        \n                        Subscribe Now\n                    Exclusively forStock Analysis \n                    Stock score of Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd is 7 on a scale of 10.\n                View Stock Analysis\u00a0\u00bbSome of the auto companies could become contrarian plays as the commodity cycle peaks out. So I am not a firm believer in this commodity supercycle theory which is floated around because with China slowing down so drastically there is unlikely to be a commodity super run. There could be run in few commodities which are specific to EVs, solar power, etc, but not in sectors like steel, which are a big part of the cost component for autos. That is one sector which has got beaten down rightly because of falling sales and impact on profitability, but that is where opportunities could come. M&M is something which is well-placed on the valuation growth paradigm there.\n\n\nNow with the uncertainty and volatility coming back, how would you approach the entire reopening trade where we had seen valuations going up, particularly in hotel stocks?We cannot have it both ways. On one side, people see that everything is normal and correction has happened and as such the market should do well. On the other side, the reopening trade should get impacted because of whatever is happening. So there is a dichotomy in that. Some wariness could come if the case numbers start increasing again and as such the performance of the reopening trade could go on the backburner. But that will be an opportunity because the strategic direction of many of these companies, specifically Indian Hotels, related to the way they are expanding, their asset light model, their tie-up for capex with the Singapore government entity as well as the deleveraging which will happen because of the rights issue - all things are going in the right direction. The uncertainty could linger a bit longer for multiplexes, but if a decent cut happens in those also, then that is also an opportunity.\n\n\nPick the best companies to investBECOME AN ETPRIME MEMBERRead More News onauto stocksauto stocks outlookM&MM&M sharesM&M share priceM&M share price targetM&M newsmahindra sharesmahindra share price(What's moving Sensex and  Nifty  Track  latest market news,  stock tips and  expert advice on  ETMarkets.

        "Article": "SynopsisThe new variant, first reported by South Africa, has already cast the world's recovery into doubt, with the EU health agency warning it could cause more than half of Europe's Covid cases in the next few months.APPeople stand in line to receive a booster shot, in Massachusetts.COVID-19 CASESWorldIndiaConfirmed33,531,498Deaths445,768Confirmed229,508,037Deaths4,707,821The United States and Australia announced their first locally transmitted cases of the Omicron variant as authorities worldwide rushed Friday to stem the spread of the heavily mutated strain of Covid-19.\n\nThe World Health Organization has said it could take weeks to determine whether Omicron is more transmissible and whether it causes more severe infections -- as well as how effective current treatments and vaccines are against it.\n\nBut the new variant, first reported by South Africa, has already cast the world's recovery into doubt, with the EU health agency warning it could cause more than half of Europe's Covid cases in the next few months.\n\nMore than two dozen governments have now detected cases of the variant -- including India, one of the countries hardest-hit by the coronavirus pandemic since it first emerged nearly two years ago.\n\nA preliminary study by South African researchers suggests the strain is three times more likely to cause reinfections compared to the Delta or Beta strains.\n\nThe research, which has not yet been peer reviewed, was described as \"very concerning\" by Michael Head, a scientist at the University of Southampton.\n\nTen cases have so far been confirmed in the United States, including five in New York announced Thursday, one in Los Angeles county, and one in Hawaii.\n\nThe Hawaii case and one in Minnesota both involved residents with no recent international travel history -- signaling the strain is already circulating inside the country.\n\n\"This is a case of community spread,\" the Hawaii Health Department said.\n\nThe cases were reported as US President Joe Biden outlined his plans to battle Covid-19 during the winter, with new testing requirements for travelers and a surge in vaccination efforts.\n\n\"It's a plan that I think should unite us,\" he said.\n\nAll incoming travelers will need to test negative within a day before their flights, and rapid tests that currently cost $25 will be covered by insurance and distributed free to the uninsured.\n\nAustralia on Friday, too, reported a student with no history of foreign travel had tested positive for the variant.\n\nThe case, detected in the country's largest city of Sydney, comes despite a sweeping ban on non-citizens entering the country and restrictions on flights from southern Africa.\n\nAnd just a day after Singapore reported two cases of the strain, neighboring Malaysia on Friday reported its first infections with the variant.\n\nThe case was detected in a foreign student travelling from South Africa, who had arrived in Malaysia on November 19, Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin said.\n\nThe case was only confirmed on December 2, after officials conducted genome sequencing on some samples taken from recent arrivals at Kuala Lumpur airport, he said.\n\nSri Lanka also announced its first Omicron case, a citizen who returned from South Africa.\n\nThe variant's detection and spread represent a major challenge to efforts to end the pandemic, with several nations already reimposing restrictions many had hoped were a thing of the past.\n\nIn Germany, outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel said large parts of public life would be \"open only to those who have been vaccinated or recovered\" from Covid-19 ahead of a vote by the country's parliament on mandatory immunizations.\n\nIt is not yet clear when the latest measures will go into effect, but the plans include a blanket ban on entering bars, restaurants and cinemas for anyone who is unvaccinated or not recovered from Covid, according to a document signed off by the leaders of the country's 16 states.\n\nThe agreement also includes new restrictions on large gatherings and the closure of nightclubs in areas with a weekly incidence rate above 350 infections per 100,000 people.\n\nFireworks will be banned on New Year's Eve to stop large crowds from gathering, according to North Rhine-Westphalia state premier Hendrik Wuest.\n\nRising infections of the Delta variant had already forced European governments to reintroduce mandatory mask-wearing, social distancing measures, curfews or lockdowns in a desperate attempt to limit hospitalizations, leaving businesses fearing another grim Christmas.\n\nIndia has yet to impose new blanket international travel bans, but its health ministry earlier this week ordered all inbound travelers from \"countries at-risk\" to undergo mandatory post-arrival Covid testing, along with the random testing of other international arrivals.\n\nWHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned of a \"toxic mix\" of low vaccination and testing rates creating a \"recipe for breeding and amplifying variants.\"\n\nAnd the United Nations said Thursday that the pandemic has pushed tens of millions more people into poverty, estimating that 274 million people would need emergency assistance next year as economies suffer with Covid-19 restrictions.\n\nRead More News oncovidnew covid variantcoronavirusomicronomicron in us(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on

        "Article": "SynopsisProtection against COVID-19 infection wanes over time, which has driven consideration of boosters to protect the most vulnerable and lessen pressure on health services.The vaccines studied were AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Novavax, Janssen, Moderna, Valneva, and Curevac.Six different COVID-19 boosters are safe and elicit strong immune response in people who have previously received a two-dose course of AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccines, according to a study published in The Lancet journal. Two doses of AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines have shown 79 per cent and 90 per cent protection, respectively, against hospitalisation and death after six months in several studies, the researchers said. \n\n However, protection against COVID-19 infection wanes over time, which has driven consideration of boosters to protect the most vulnerable and lessen pressure on health services. \n\n The latest study looked at safety, immune response and side-effects of seven vaccines when used as a third booster jab. \n\n The vaccines studied were AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Novavax, Janssen, Moderna, Valneva, and Curevac. \n\n \"The side effect data show all seven vaccines are safe to use as 3rd doses, with acceptable levels of inflammatory side effects like injection site pain, muscle soreness, fatigue,\" said Professor Saul Faust, trial lead from the University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, UK. \n\n \"Whilst all boosted spike protein immunogenicity after two doses of AstraZeneca, only AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Novavax, Janssen and Curevac did so after two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech,\" Faust said. \n\n The researchers noted that these results relate only to these vaccines as boosters to the two primary vaccinations, and to the immune response they drive at 28 days. \n\n Further work will generate data at three months and one year after people have received their boosters, which will provide insights into their impact on long-term protection and immunological memory, they said. \n\n A randomised, phase 2 trial of the seven booster vaccines was conducted, with the third doses given 10-12 weeks after initial two-dose courses of AstraZeneca or Pfizer-BioNTech. \n\n The trial involved 2,878 participants in good health recruited at 18 UK sites between June 1 and June 30, 2021. \n\n Around half of participants received two doses of AstraZeneca and half two doses of Pfizer. \n\n The control vaccine used was a meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY). \n\n Participants were aged 30 years or older, with approximately half aged 70 years or older. \n\n Thirteen experimental and control arms of the trial were split into three participant groups, with six sites per group. \n\n Group A received Novavax, half dose Novavax, AstraZeneca, or a control. Group B received Pfizer, Valneva, half dose Valneva, Janssen or a control. \n\n Group C received Moderna, Curevac, which was withdrawn from further clinical development in October 2021, half dose Pfizer, or a control. \n\n Primary outcomes were adverse effects seven days after receiving a booster, and levels of antibodies targeting the spike protein on the surface of COVID-19 virus cells - which enables them to enter human cells - after 28 days, compared to controls. \n\n Secondary outcomes included the response of T cells -- which play a key role in the immune response to viral infection, and seem important in controlling disease severity -- to wild type, Alpha, Beta, and Delta variants. \n\n Both antibody-mediated immunity and T-cell response are known to be important in vaccine effectiveness, the researchers said. \n\n Increases in anti-spike protein antibody levels after 28 days varied across the vaccines. \n\n After two doses of AstraZeneca these ranged from 1.8 times higher to 32.3 times higher according to the booster vaccine used. \n\n After two doses of Pfizer the range was 1.3 times higher to 11.5 times higher. \n\n Significant T-cell responses were reported in several combinations, the researchers said. \n\n At 28 days, all booster results were similar for participants aged 30-69 years and those aged 70 years or older, they said. \n\n The authors warn that the boost ratios should be interpreted with caution because they relate to immunogenicity rather than protection against disease, and the relationship between antibody levels at day 28 and long-term protection and immunological memory is unknown. \n\n Reactions to all seven vaccines were similar, with fatigue, headache, and injection site pain most often reported. \n\n The authors highlighted several limitations to the study. \n\n Due to pandemic timelines and the need to generate data to inform policy in September 2021, the interval between second and third doses was shorter in some participants than between their first two doses. \n\n Several studies have shown that a longer time period between the first and second doses may improve immunogenicity, including improved antibody responses when the initial BNT doses are spaced by 12 weeks rather than three weeks. \n\n This could mean that the boost in immunity is lower than if longer dose intervals had been used, the researchers added.\nRead More News oncovid booster doseBooster dosecovid vaccinevaccinecovid(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

At that valuation, the stock could trade at Rs 690, CLSA said, which was double Thursday's closing price of Rs 342.15.

It noted that while Goenka will continue to lead the merged company as its CEO, he would be the only ZEE executive to have a board seat. Five on the nine-member board would be top Sony executives.\n\nCLSA said: \"ZEE's ad revenue surged 52 per cent in H1FY22 and we expect the momentum to continue, which could double profit and cash by FY24. Strong revenue growth, cash flow and better governance should drive its valuations. We base our Rs 415 target on 18 times December 2023 earnings, factoring in a 33 per cent discount for risks of delays to the merger.\"\n\nThe management expects there could be 10 per cent revenue synergies. CLSA said the profit of the combined entity would jump 2.5 times to $690 million by FY24. ZEE Entertainment, with improving viewership and content edge, is benefitting from a strong uptick in ad spend and phenomenal OTT user growth.\n\nThe brokerage group said a robust growth in OTT streaming would drive digital media's reach to 65 crore, surpassing that of print, making it the number 2 media after TV. But the rise of OTT would have a limited impact on TV's reach as OTT has been a supplement to TV so far, and its survey of 1,000 consumers have suggested the same. \"Also, about 9 crore of India's 30 crore households still do not own a TV,\" it added.\n\nPick the best companies to investBECOME AN ETPRIME MEMBERRead More News onZee stockZee stock priceCLSAZee stock outlookZee stock news(What's moving Sensex and  Nifty  Track  latest market news,  stock tips and  expert advice on  ETMarkets.

Higher FCF would typically support demand for commercial vehicles,\" said Crisil.Getty ImagesWhile the Centre and some state governments have cut taxes on diesel, there was a decline in the movement of freight in November because of slower industrial activity, said Crisil in a research report on freight.\n\n\"The quantum of freight moved was flat to negative on- month after the pre-festive buzz in October,\" said the report.\n\nCRISFrex captures the changes in freight rates on a sequential basis. \"What makes it the first-of-its-kind in India is that it also tracks free cash flows (FCF; pre-EMI), of transporters on an ongoing basis. Higher FCF would typically support demand for commercial vehicles,\" said Crisil.\n\nThe report noted: \"Freight rates for haulage of essentials such as FMCG/FMCD have remained relatively resilient in November. After the festive stock-up, freight rates for discretionary goods such as auto carriers and textiles are seeing more pressure compared with other sectors Mining, cement and steel freight rates have also seen some correction as infrastructure-building activity was a wee subdued on-month. But this correction is not significantly more than the fall in diesel price in the case of cement. The situation needs to be monitored for the next 1-2 months.\"\n\nIn the first week of November, the central government announced a Rs 10 per litre reduction in the Central Excise applicable on diesel. A few states followed suit by announcing additional cuts in state taxes (VAT) on diesel.\n\nThis may seem to augur well for the profitability of transporters. \"However, the freight industry is very dynamic and competitive, so demand-supply factors also play a material role in freight rates. The excise duty cut translates to a 3-5% reduction in the cost structure of a transporter. Add the cropping of VAT rates by a few states, and the reduction would be 4-6%,\" said Crisil.\n\nFreightSigns finds that consumer essentials such as agri- products and FMCG/FMCD are the most resilient and stable segments driving the trucking industry, even in the current context. This was seen in November also, when haulage of FMCG/FMCD saw the lowest correction among all the commodity types tracked by FreightSigns. Discretionary goods such as automobiles and textiles are seeing the highest correction in freight rates \u2014 about 10% \u2014because dispatches have been under pressure. Industrials such as mining products (coal, iron ore, limestone), cement and steel are seeing a slight moderation in freight rates relative to the diesel price cut. In adjacencies, slack freight demand for mining/ construction aggregates, cement and steel haulage is reflecting in the lack of interest among transporters to buy new tippers and high-tonnage tractor-trailers typically used in these segments.\n\n\"All this has resulted in the CRISFrex Index dropping to 114 in November 2021 from 122 in October. But the on-month decline in margins has been relatively less because FCF (pre-EMI) \u2014 as assessed by CRISIL Research \u2014 are estimated to be ~15% of the freight earnings, compared with ~17% in October. The margins, nevertheless, remain slightly above August levels,\" the report said.\n\nRead More News oncrisilindustrial activityfreight movementfreight movement in Novemberfree cash flows(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

NEW DELHI: The rupee was largely steady against the US dollar in early trade on Friday as strength in the domestic equities offset an overnight rise in global crude oil prices and a stronger greenback globally. However, investors preferred to keep off large bets ahead of the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s monetary policy statement on Wednesday, dealers said.\n\nThe partially convertible rupee opened at 74.9800 per US dollar as against 74.9950 at previous close. So far in the day, the Indian currency moved in a band of 74.9600-75.0150 against the greenback.\n\nInvestors said that after the volatility witnessed earlier in the week, the rupee was consolidating around its current levels.\n\nIn the three trading days following the detection of the \u2018Omicron\u2019 strain of the coronavirus (November 26), the rupee tumbled close to 1 per cent against the US dollar as investors made a beeline for safe-haven assets and chose to pare exposure to riskier emerging market currencies such as the Indian unit.\n\nA decidedly hawkish policy commentary by US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell earlier this week also hurt sentiment for the rupee and fuelled fears of outflows of overseas investment from India amid the likelihood of interest rates heading higher in the world\u2019s largest economy.\n\nThe dollar index, which measures the US currency against six major rival currencies, rose to 96.17 on Friday as against a low of 95.67 touched earlier this week.\n\nThe rupee, however, was spared much pain as Indian equities have enjoyed a good run over the last couple of days and as some banks sold the dollar on account of overseas companies\u2019 investments in Indian firms\u2019 initial public offerings, dealers said.\n\n\u201cWe have consolidated to a very tight range. From the lows of 75.20 against the US dollar, we have come back roughly to the 75-per dollar level where there is also some degree of exporter selling,\u201d a dealer with a state-owned bank said on condition of anonymity.\n\n\u201cThere will be a gradual depreciation as the Fed starts tapering faster but for now all eyes are on the RBI\u2019s policy; volumes are very low. The rally in equities has kept the rupee supported today but barring any global developments, we see the currency in a very tight range,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Nifty50 index was up 0.4 per cent at 17,483.9 points, while the BSE-Sensex was at 58717.9 points, up 0.4 per cent.\n\nSovereign bonds were steady too as traders awaited the crucial monetary policy statement and as banks refrained from heavy purchases ahead of fresh supply of gilts worth Rs 24,000 crore hitting the market through a primary auction Friday.\n\nYield on the 10-year benchmark 6.10 per cent 2031 paper was last at 6.36 per cent one basis point higher than previous close. Bond yields and prices move inversely.\n\nSpeculation is rife that the RBI could formally start the process of normalising policy amid signs of higher inflation by lifting the reverse repo rate from its current record low of 3.35 per cent.\n\nUnlike developed economies, where higher interest rates typically boost the local currency, the rupee tends to suffer when monetary policy is tightened as equity markets suffer outflows.\n\nPick the best companies to investBECOME AN ETPRIME MEMBERRead More News onrupee todayrupee rate todayrupee exchange ratereserve bank of indiaomicron(What's moving Sensex and  Nifty  Track  latest market news,  stock tips and  expert advice on  ETMarkets.

        "Article": "SynopsisMuch remains unknown about the new variant, including whether it is more contagious, as some health authorities suspect, or if it makes people more seriously ill, and whether it can thwart the vaccine.World Health Organization officials in the Western Pacific say border closures adopted by some countries may buy time to deal with the omicron coronavirus variant, but measures put in place and experience gained in dealing with the delta variant should remain the foundation for fighting the pandemic. \n\n While a few regional countries are facing surges, COVID-19 cases and deaths in many others have decreased and plateaued, WHO Regional Director for the Western Pacific Dr. Takeshi Kasai told reporters Friday in a virtual news conference broadcast from Manila, Philippines. \n\n \"Border control can delay the virus coming in and buy time. But every country and every community must prepare for new surges in cases,\" Kasai said. \"The positive news in all of this is that none of the information we have currently about omicron suggests we need to change the directions of our response.\"\n\n Much remains unknown about the new variant, including whether it is more contagious, as some health authorities suspect, or if it makes people more seriously ill, and whether it can thwart the vaccine. \n\n Kasai said omicron has been designated a variant of concern because of the number of mutations and because early information suggests it may be more transmissible than other variants of the virus. More testing and observation is necessary, he said. \n\n Thus far, four countries and regions in the Western Pacific - Australia, Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea - have reported cases of the omicron variant, said WHO Regional Emergency Director Dr. Babatunde Olowokure. That number is likely to go up as more cases are discovered globally, Olowokure said.\n\n India, Singapore and Malaysia have also reported their first cases in the last 24 hours. \n\n \"In terms of what countries should be doing now, our experiences over the last few years, especially in responding to delta, provides a guide of what we need to do, as well as how to cope with future surges in a more sustainable way,\" he said. \n\n Those include full vaccination coverage, social distancing, mask wearing and other measures. Those can then be calibrated in response to the local context, Olowokure said. \n\n The goal is to \"ensure we are treating the right patients in the right place at the right time, and so therefore ensuring that ICU beds are available, particularly for those who need them,\" he said.\n\n Despite the positive trends in handling the pandemic in the Western Pacific region, largely through high vaccination rates, \"we cannot be complacent,\" Kasai said. \n\n Globally, cases have been increasing for seven consecutive weeks and the number of deaths has started to rise again too, driven largely by the delta variant and decreased use of protective measures in other parts of the world, he said. \n\n \"We should not be surprised to see more surges in the future. As long as transmission continues, the virus can continue to mutate as the emergence of omicron demonstrates, reminding us of the need to stay vigilant,\" Kasai said. \n\n He warned especially about the likelihood of surges due to more gatherings and movement of people during the holiday season. The northern winter season will likely bring other infectious respiratory diseases such as influenza alongside COVID-19, Kasai said. \n\n \"It is clear that this pandemic is far from over and I know that people are worried about omicron,\" he said. \"But my message today is that we can adapt the way we manage this virus to better cope with the future surges and reduce their health, social and economic impacts.\" \n\n The WHO Western Pacific Region includes 37 countries and areas from Palau to Mongolia.\n\nRead More News onwhodeltaomicroncovid variantcovid precaution(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

The year-to-date (YTD) return of their benchmark indices has been in the range of 39-56%.iStockA little over 50% of equity schemes have beaten their benchmarks in this calendar year so far, shows data from Value Research, a mutual fund tracking firm. As per data, as many as 461 equity mutual fund schemes, out of some 905 schemes, beat their respective benchmark indices in the period between January and mid-November.\n\nEquity schemes such as Quant Small Cap Fund and Quant Infrastructure Fund have given returns over 80% each in this calendar year. The year-to-date (YTD) return of their benchmark indices has been in the range of 39-56%.\n\nKotak Small Cap Fund, Principal Small Cap Fund, Tata Small Cap Fund, Nippon India Small Cap Fund, Canara Robeco Small Cap Fund, BOI AXA Small Cap Fund and Edelweiss Small Cap Fund are among the top-performing schemes of the year, each giving a return of over 60% this year so far.\n\n\n\nSmall cap funds have fared better as most top-performing equity schemes belong to the small cap category. Out of 53 small cap funds, as many as 33 beat their benchmark indices in this year. In other words, around 62% small cap schemes beat their benchmark indices, according to Value Research data.\n\n\n\nMid cap schemes have done relatively poorly in the current year. Out of 59 mid cap schemes, only 23 schemes managed to beat their benchmark indices. That means only 39% mid cap schemes beat their benchmarks.\n\n\n\nThe performance of large cap funds have been subdued. Out of 191 large cap equity schemes, only 43 could beat their benchmark index. In percentage terms, nearly 23% large cap schemes could beat their benchmark indicex, data available with Value Research shows.\n\n\n\nFund managers and wealth advisors point out that the performance of equity schemes has been in line with expectations.\n\n\"I would say the performance of mutual funds as a whole has been in line with expectations if you compare this to more matured markets like the US. It is common to see even 80% of actively managed funds actually underperforming their benchmarks in matured markets,\" said Suvajit Ray, Head of Products, IIFL Securities.\n\nJharna Agarwal, Head - Products at Anand Rathi Preferred, also highlights the role of fund managers in outperforming the benchmarks.\n\n\"At large, equity mutual funds have done well this year. A lot of fund managers have been very nimble in their portfolio construction strategy. New pockets of investments and tweaks in portfolios as per the emerging trends seem to have worked in favour of equity funds,\" said Agarwal.\n\nEquity mutual fund investors need to keep in mind that the market may remain volatile in the short term, fund advisors warn.\n\n\"After the supernormal returns we have seen in the last 18 months (over 100% in large caps and 200% in mid & small caps), it is important for investors to moderate their return expectations from equity investments to more long term average kind of returns, that this asset class has given \u2013 about 12% to 15% per annum,\" said Ray.\n\n\"Investors with long term investment horizon of 5 years plus can continue to hold their equity mutual fund investments. Also, SIPs are always a good way to build a corpus in equity mutual funds,\" he said.\n\nRead More News onmutual fundsmutual fund newslargecap schemestop equity schemesinvesting(Catch all the latest news about  mutual funds, MF insights & analysis, best buys and investment trends on  ETMutualFunds.com)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

        "Article": "SynopsisThe US Federal Trade Commission has sued to block the Nvidia-Arm deal, saying that it would give the US firm control over computing technology and designs that competitors rely on to develop their own competing chips.APThe US Federal Trade Commission has sued to block US chip company Nvidia Corp.'s more than $80 billion planned acquisition of British chip technology provider Arm Ltd., adding to already significant global regulatory challenges of the deal.\n\nThe FTC said the proposed Nvidia-Arm deal would give one of the largest chip companies control over computing technology and designs that competitors rely on to develop their own competing chips.\n\nThe deal has been widely expected to fall apart after facing opposition in the chip industry. British regulators said last month they would launch an in-depth probe of the deal, and it is also under scrutiny in the European Union.\n\nArm licenses its chip architecture and blueprints to major chip makers Apple Inc., Qualcomm Inc and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., underpinning the global smartphone ecosystem. Arm was sold to Japan's SoftBank Group Corp. in 2016. \n\nNvidia said it would \u201cwork to demonstrate that this transaction will benefit the industry and promote competition\u201d. Arm declined to comment.\n\nThe stock-heavy deal has more than doubled in value since it was announced in September 2020 as Nvidia shares have risen on the performance of its data centre business. Nvidia will owe only a $1.25 billion breakup fee if the deal does not close, and its shares closed up 2.2% at $321.26 on Thursday.\nSTARTUP ROCKSTARS IN 2021Sign-in to see our list of the most promising startups of 2021SIGN INThank You!\n    \t\t            For being a subscriber of ETtech Top 5 newsletter.\n    \t\t            \nHere is your chance to spread the word & win exclusive rewards!\n    \t\t        Unlock Rewards\n\u201cNobody thinks the deal is going to close,\u201d said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein. \"The data centre story has been really playing out. The software narrative has become a bigger piece of the story. I would love to see this deal, but I don't think they need it.\u201d\n\nBefore Nvidia\u2019s offer, Softbank had planned to file for an initial public offering for Arm. While Arm\u2019s revenue is growing briskly, rising 56.3% to $1.46 billion in the six months ended Sept. 30, it is unclear whether Arm, in an IPO, would fetch anything close to the $80 billion in value offered by Nvidia.\n\nThat would be a new blow for the Japanese conglomerate whose Vision Fund assets sank by $10 billion last month, driven by plummeting valuations for investments in Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba and ride-hailing service Didi Global Inc.\n\nThe US FTC, which is made up of two Republicans and two Democrats, voted 4-0 to approve the challenge to the planned merger.\n\n\n\u2018Higher Prices, Less Choice\u2019\nThe FTC alleged \u201cthe proposed merger would give Nvidia the ability and incentive to use its control of this technology to undermine its competitors, reducing competition and ultimately resulting in reduced product quality, reduced innovation, higher prices, and less choice, harming the millions of Americans who benefit from Arm-based products\u201d.\n\nThe FTC added the combined firm \"would have the means and incentive to stifle innovative next-generation technologies, including those used to run datacenters and driver-assistance systems in cars\u201d.\n\nSome semiconductor firms such as MediaTek Inc. and Broadcom Inc. have voiced support for the deal. But other firms such as Qualcomm have opposed it over concerns that Nvidia would have a first look at key technologies that they depend on and could then have better insights into their future products.\n\nQualcomm did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nNvidia's Chief Executive Jensen Huang, made a biting comment at an industry dinner last month, saying that Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon\u2014who recently took the helm of an industry trade group\u2014had proven to be a master advocate in the battle over Arm. Qualcomm had its own extensive battles with global regulators, including the FTC, which Qualcomm prevailed over after the regulator brought an antitrust lawsuit against it.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the perfect person to advocate for our industry,\u201d Huang said from a stage as Amon sat in the audience. \u201cI was trying to figure out, how is it possible that Cristiano knew every single regulator on the planet, and by the time I got there to tell them about my story on Arm, he was already there advocating against it?\u201d Huang said, to stunned laughter from the crowd.\n\nThe FTC said it has cooperated closely with staff of the competition agencies in the EU, the UK, Japan and South Korea.\n\n\nReuters\u2019 Diane Bartz and Kanishka Singh contributed to this story.\n\nRead More News onnvidia arm dealus federal trade commissionsemiconductor chipsglobal chip shortagequalcomm technologiessamsung electronicsapple siliconUS Semicoductor ManufacturingStay on top of technology and startup news that matters.

The economy grew 8.4% annually during the July-September quarter.\n\n That positive momentum seems to have been largely sustained in the first two months of this quarter.\n\n The Services Purchasing Managers' Index, compiled by IHS Markit, eased to 58.1 in November from 58.4 in October, but last month's rate of growth was the second-best in over a decade and well above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction for a fourth straight month.\n\n Excluding October, new business expanded at its quickest pace in nearly nine years in November, primarily driven by the robust recovery in domestic demand.\n\n \"The recovery of the Indian service sector was extended to November. Companies were somewhat convinced that output levels would continue to increase in the year ahead, but worries regarding inflationary pressures weighed on confidence again,\" noted Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit.\n\n Despite reporting the biggest jump in input costs since April, firms were only able to pass on some of costs to customers, pointing to further pressure on margins. Prices charged rose at a slower pace in November compared to October.\n\n The pace of hiring was also the weakest in three months despite an improvement in business expectations.\n\n Adding to concerns, the recent emergence of the Omicron coronavirus variant has raised the chances of another blow to the economy.\n\n However, robust expansion in services activity along with strong growth in manufacturing boosted the composite index to a near 10-year high of 59.2 in November from 58.7 in October.\n\n \"Looking at the manufacturing and service sectors combined, the results are even more encouraging and bode well for economic performance in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021/22 so far,\" added De Lima.\n\nRead More News onServices PMIihs markitomicronManufacturing PMIPMIIndiaEconomy(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

        "Article": "SynopsisAt some point, a way of living that most of us describe as normal will arrive - it always does. But it will be a new normal. The pandemic in our mind has very different twists and turns to the pandemic that is measured by cases, hospitalisations and deaths.COVID-19 CASESWorldIndiaConfirmed33,531,498Deaths445,768Confirmed229,508,037Deaths4,707,821No one can ever know for sure when life will return to normal after a particular event, not least because what's normal keeps on changing, even in normal times. Nevertheless, it's a question we can't help pondering - particularly when new COVID developments, such as the emergence of the omicron variant, keep on shifting the pandemic's goalposts. \n\n It's a question that Britain's Office for National Statistics (ONS) has been pondering too. On March 27, 2020, the ONS began asking a large sample of the British population when they thought life would return to normal. This was very shortly after the first wave of the pandemic had begun, with COVID cases and deaths quickly rising. Britain was just days into its first lockdown. \n\n The ONS surveyed people that day and for the next ten days. Only 15% at that time said they were unsure when life would return to normal, and just 11% of the population thought it might take a year or more. The remaining three-quarters thought that life would be back to normal within a year of March 2020. \n\n No one back then thought that life might never return to normal. The majority thought normality would return within six months. We humans are (usually) an optimistic bunch. \n\n Over the subsequent 20 months, the ONS carried out a further 76 surveys, usually one every week. They asked the same question in each survey about when people in Great Britain thought that life might return to normal. \n\n By the time of the 77th survey, which ended on November 14 2021, the proportion of people who said they were unsure when life would return to normal had doubled to 31%. The proportion who thought it would be at least a year before there was a return to normality had tripled to 35%. \n\n A further 14% thought that life would never return to normal ever again. And the proportion who thought that life would return to normal within a year had plunged from three-quarters to just a fifth. Our faith in a return to normality has collapsed. \n\n So far the great rise in uncertainty has come in two waves. The first uncertainty wave peaked in August 2020, when COVID cases and deaths were almost zero. After that our levels of uncertainty fell, linearly, to mid-January 2021. \n\n At this point, more of us thought we knew what might happen next than at any other point across the 77 surveys. However, after that we slowly but surely became increasingly more unsure as to what the future might hold. Wave two of being unsure may not yet have peaked. \n\n\nWe define our own normality At some point, a way of living that most of us describe as normal will arrive - it always does. But it will be a new normal. The pandemic in our mind has very different twists and turns to the pandemic that is measured by cases, hospitalisations and deaths. \n\n Because it exists in our heads as well as in the physical world, the pandemic is partly about us - how we each individually feel. The return of normality therefore won't be marked by life returning to what it was before 2020, but by us feeling that things are normal again. \n\n In the most recent of the 77 surveys, three in five adults said they had \"avoided physical contact with others outside their home in the past seven days\". Two in five reported that \"only their immediate family had been in their home in the past seven days\". Neither of these measures had changed from the previous survey. If, for instance, this pattern of behaviour continues similarly unchanged, it's possible that in time, this will come feel like normality. \n\n On the other hand, the question the ONS has now asked 77 different groups of people (all chosen at random) is not specifically about the pandemic - it is about \"life\" in general. It's very probable that at first most people replied to the question with the pandemic foremost in their mind. However, as time has passed, other aspects of life will have shifted too. \n\n Things are always changing. People's answers may have come to reflect this, and regardless of the pandemic, may be defining normality as a past that can't be recovered. \n\n We're now very close to a point where the majority of adults believe that it will take at least a year (into 2023) for normality to resume - or that it will never return. And of those who don't think this, the majority of them are increasingly unsure about what will happen. \n\n At some point, the majority of us will become used to how things have changed, and we will begin to see our changed world as normal. For those of us who have lived through the pandemic, it will be in our minds forever. But how we look back and remember the pandemic, and the times before March 2020, will keep on changing. \n\n\n(The author is Halford Mackinder Professor of Geography, University of Oxford, London.

Reports suggest as many as 12 patients suspected to be infected with the COVID-19 'Omicron' variant have been admitted to Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan (LNJP) hospital in Delhi so far on Friday.\n\n\nHarmony with Fed: The hawkish commentary by the US Fed chair on inflation has been digested by the market. Investors see the hawkish pivot from the US Fed chair as evidence that the central bank does not wish to be left too much behind-the-curve that could cause it to raise interest rates at a faster rate later and push the US economy into a recession.\n\n\nLack of conviction: While benchmark indices have made a smart pullback after slipping below 17,000 points earlier this week, investors are unlikely to make bold bullish bets in the market till new triggers emerge.

Nifty Smallcap gained 0.82 per cent and Nifty Midcap fell 0.01 per cent. Nifty 500, the broadest index on NSE, ended down 0.79 per cent.\n\n\n\"Participants have no option but to align their position accordingly and prefer hedged positions.

But that is likely to take months.\n\nThe carrier, which did not immediately comment on Thursday, was ordered by the FCC on Oct. 26 to discontinue US services by early January.\n\nThe FCC said China Telecom \"is subject to exploitation, influence, and control by the Chinese government and is highly likely to be forced to comply with Chinese government requests without sufficient legal procedures subject to independent judicial oversight.\"\nSTARTUP ROCKSTARS IN 2021Sign-in to see our list of the most promising startups of 2021SIGN INThank You!\n    \t\t            For being a subscriber of ETtech Top 5 newsletter.\n    \t\t            \nHere is your chance to spread the word & win exclusive rewards!\n    \t\t        Unlock Rewards\nChina Telecom, which has been authorized for 20 years to provide telecommunications services in the United States, had more than 335 million subscribers worldwide in 2019.

The second wave of Covid-19 caused devastating losses to the Indian populace and public health specialists are now debating what kind of damage the Omicron variant might cause.ReutersRepresentative imageCOVID-19 CASESWorldIndiaConfirmed33,531,498Deaths445,768Confirmed229,508,037Deaths4,707,821Much has been made about the potential that can be caused by the Omicron variant of coronavirus and India, especially, is concerned if it can cause as much damage as the Delta variant did early this year. The second wave of Covid-19 caused devastating losses to the Indian populace and public health specialists are now debating what kind of damage the Omicron variant might cause.\n\nDR NK Mehra, An honourary emeritus scientist of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), told the Times of India that information available so far suggests that Omicron is more transmissible and therefore, it has the potential to replace Delta as the predominant variant. \"In South Africa, the Alpha variant was predominant initially but was overtaken by Delta. And now, 70% of all Covid-19 cases are being caused by Omicron variant,\" he said.\n\n\"South Africa has the largest population suffering from HIV/AIDS. It also has low vaccination rates. This could be the reason behind the increased need for hospitalisation in persons affected by Covid-19 due to the Omicron variant. It is too early to say whether the predominance of the new variant will have a similar impact in India where a significant number of adults have been vaccinated. If you look at reports from other countries that have reported detection of the Omicron variant, there aren't any cases with severe symptoms,\" he further added..\n\nDr SK Sarin, director of the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS), has said that it takes 8-12 weeks for a new variant to overtake the existing one. But there is a high rate of replication being seen when it comes to Omicron. He says because of this, the new variant may spread faster. \"We need to be more vigilant about adopting preventive measures and strengthening steps required to detect and isolate positive cases early on,\" he said.\n\nNoted public health analyst and epidemiologist Dr Chandrakant Lahariyahas said that there were fewer chances of the Omicron variant causing a crisis similar to the one seen during the second wave of the pandemic in India. \n\nLok Nayak Hospital in Delhi has been designated to isolate and treat international travellers who test positive for Covid-19. Dr Suresh Kumar, the hospital's medical director, said that the viruses are known to evolve to be able to survive. \"SARS-CoV-2 has also evolved. But we don't know for sure whether they have become more deadly. Chances are that the new variant may cause milder symptoms,\" he said.\n\nRead More News onomicronindialok nayak hospitalCoronavirusCOVIDB.1.159(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

But it warned that severe supply-related constraints continued to hinder operations across the region.\n\nActivity in Asia benefited from an easing of lockdown and border restrictions, separate surveys showed. A day earlier, figures showed China\u2019s factory activity improved in November as the impact of a power crunch subsided and more working days in the month helped boost output.\n\nEurope\u2019s positive headline number was somewhat overshadowed by other trends within the data, according to Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. \n\n\u201cA strong headline PMI reading masks just how tough business conditions are for manufacturers at the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough demand remains strong, as witnessed by a further solid improvement in new order inflows, supply chains continue to deteriorate at a worrying rate.\u201d\n\nInput shortages have restricted production growth so far in the fourth quarter to the weakest seen in the past year and a half, he said.\n\nFactories across Southeast Asia had been on a recovery path as loosened movement restrictions allowed output to catch up before the crucial year-end holiday season.\n\nMalaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines all saw rises in their PMIs, while Thailand\u2019s saw a slight decline to 50.6, though still above the 50 reading that separates expansion from contraction. India\u2019s PMI increased to 57.6 -- the highest reading since January.\n\nIn northern Asia, manufacturing activity in Taiwan and trade bellwether South Korea held in expansionary territory, while Japan\u2019s PMI rose to 54.5, its highest since January 2018.\n\nMeanwhile, separate data from South Korea out Wednesday showed exports last month rose more than expected and are headed for an annual record, suggesting global trade is continuing to recover.\n\nChina\u2019s official manufacturing PMI increased to 50.1, the first time in three months it exceeded the 50 mark. The non-manufacturing gauge, which measures activity in the construction and services sectors, fell slightly to 52.3.\n\nBut it\u2019s news of the latest Covid-19 variant, omicron, that perhaps presents the biggest headwind. The new strain is seen as a potential threat to industrial production across the world after the delta variant forced factories to shut and further snarled supply chains. \n\nRead More News onfactoryomicronlockdownihs markitpmi(The one-stop destination for MSME, ET RISE provides news, views and analysis around GST, Exports, Funding, Policy and small business management.)

Demand is rising in parts of Asia, and the remedy from Beijing and New Delhi to recent power shortages was to ramp up coal production.\n\nExports from Carmichael will be used to supply electricity to India and nations in Southeast Asia, according to Bravus Mining & Resources, an Adani unit in Australia. Analysts expect at least some of the material to be used by the conglomerate\u2019s own power plants, though the company declined to specify details of its customers.\n\n\u201cWe have already secured the market for the 10 million tons per annum of coal,\u201d Bravus said in a statement, confirming its export plans are on track. \u201cThe coal will be sold at index adjusted pricing,\u201d and all taxes and royalties will be paid locally, according to the company. Seaborne coal prices have swung wildly in recent weeks, plunging from a record high in October and then recovering some of the gains. \n\nThe project, which the company self-financed, has been scaled back from initial plans for a A$16 billion ($11 billion) operation that could yield 60 million tons a year. The company also lists more than 100 approvals secured for the development, and has developed conservation strategies including plans to protect the endangered black-throated finch, found in the project area\n\nAustralia\u2019s government also argues that local mines like Carmichael could reduce global emissions, as the coal is higher quality and will displace the use of more polluting fuel.\n\nAdani, Asia\u2019s second-richest man and the founder of the Adani Group, is facing sharp criticism as his companies seek to add investments in fossil fuels \u2014 including coal mines and power plants \u2014 even as he heralds a $70 billion campaign to build a world-leading renewable energy giant.\n\n\u201cWe are doing all we can to make renewables a viable, affordable alternative to fossil fuels,\u201d Adani told the Bloomberg India Economic Forum last month, lending support to Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s goal for the world\u2019s third-biggest polluter to zero out emissions by 2070.\n\nEnding India\u2019s reliance on coal, which accounts for about 70% of electricity generation, is pivotal to that target, and Adani\u2019s opponents point to proposals that could almost double the group\u2019s coal-fired power capacity, and dramatically boost production of the fuel.\n\n\u201cAdani is trying to walk both sides of the street,\u201d said Tim Buckley, director of energy finance studies at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.\n\nThe Carmichael project has commanded such wide attention over its initial planned scale, which could\u2019ve created Australia\u2019s largest coal mine, the fact it\u2019ll boost global supply just as nations including the U.S. urge consumers to rapidly phase out the fuel\u2019s use, and over opposition from some Indigenous landowners.\n\nThere have also been enduring concerns that the development, which includes a 200-kilometer (124 mile) railroad, could help enable a series of mines in Queensland\u2019s previously untouched Galilee Basin, a coal-rich region about the same size as the U.K.\n\nThough other proposals have made little recent progress, the Galilee Basin could potentially produce as much as 200 million tons a year \u2014 about the same as Australia\u2019s existing thermal coal exports. Campaigners describe the prospect of new mines producing those volumes as \u201can unconscionable carbon bomb.\u201d\n\nThe project has even impacted Australia\u2019s politics. A defense of coal jobs by Prime Minister Scott Morrison\u2019s governing coalition allowed it to hold support in Queensland\u2019s mining strongholds in a 2019 national election and retain office. Morrison\u2019s government is now facing criticism over a plan for net zero emissions which predicts coal and gas exports \u2014 forecast to deliver earnings of about A$110 billion this fiscal year \u2014 can continue beyond 2050.\n\nDebate over the operation has been global. Paris-based Amundi SA sold holdings of State Bank of India\u2019s green bonds because of the institution\u2019s exposure to the mine, and Bank of New York Mellon Corp. said last month it would sever ties with Carmichael. Siemens AG faced street protests in Munich, and was scolded by both BlackRock Inc. and Fridays for Future activists, including Greta Thunberg, over a contract to supply rail signaling equipment for the project.\n\nLenders including Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. and Investec Plc specifically ruled out financing the mine, while banks like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. effectively excluded themselves by setting tighter policies on coal.\n\nAs Adani makes final preparations to ship initial cargoes, it\u2019s facing new attempted disruptions. In recent days, protesters clambered aboard coal-laden wagons and laid themselves across a railroad that connects Carmichael to an export terminal. Authorities are failing to ensure there are sufficient deterrents to prevent unsafe protests that put lives at risk, Adani\u2019s Abbot Point Operations unit said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s people power that\u2019s slowed down Adani\u2019s mine,\u201d campaigner Andy Paine said Tuesday in a video, tethered to a rail with a steel pipe on the outskirts of the town of Bowen. \u201cIt\u2019s people power that will save us from climate destruction.\u201d\n\nRead More News onadanicoal mineclimate changeCarmichael mineaustralia coal minecoal mining(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

I am just getting started with mutual funds. Since I have a 30-year horizon, I would like to invest for the long term and build a corpus of Rs 10 crore as a moderate investor, but I am ready for some additional risk. Initially, I am going with SIP of Parag Parikh Flexi Cap of Rs 5,000, Canara Robeco Bluechip of Rs 4,000 and Axis Growth Opportunities Fund of Rs 3,500. I will be adding more to increase monthly amounts in these funds in the years to come. Also, I will be including Mirae Asset Tax Saver ELSS Fund to my portfolio in the future for tax savings and as an instrument for long-time wealth creation. Can you please review my portfolio? Please let me know if I am heading in the right direction. In case of any extensive portfolio overlap, what are the recommended funds that I could choose?-Joen Gavin\n\nAssuming an annual return of 12%, you need to invest around Rs 28,500 every month to make Rs 10 crore in 30 years. You need to invest more if you delay it by a lot of years. Increase your investments every year. It will help you to meet your target. Also, don\u2019t just take one large figure like Rs 10 crore to take care of all your future needs. Be realistic and list all your goals and find out how much you need to achieve them. Also, calculate how much you need to invest every month to achieve each goal. It will impart the much-needed discipline in your financial life.\n\nA moderate investor is typically asked to invest in flexi cap funds. If he wants to diversify the portfolio and reduce risk, he is also asked to invest in large cap funds. Axis Growth Opportunities Funds is a large & mid cap fund. Large & mid cap funds are mandated to invest 35% in large cap and 35% in mid cap stocks. They are not recommended to moderate investors as they carry higher risk.\n\n(If you have any mutual fund queries, message us on ET Mutual Funds on Facebook.

India\u2019s government plans to bridge the gaps in employment data by next year, with officials gathering details on the job status of about half a billion workers to improve policy making, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nFor the informal sector, which covers over 75% of the workforce, the government will derive data from surveys of migrant laborers and domestic workers as well as information submitted through a new online portal, the people said, asking not to be identified citing rules for speaking to media. \n\nThe push to collect data could help Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s administration formulate better policies to create jobs and offer skills training given that the informal sector accounts for roughly half of India\u2019s GDP. This has become all the more crucial after the mass exodus of migrant workers due to a Covid-19 lockdown earlier this year led to a labor shortage in cities and affected the efficacy of government programs. \n\nEconomists have described India\u2019s jobs data as outdated and inadequate, with the government coming up short in addressing the problem. Markets and academicians prefer to rely on the survey-based unemployment data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy Pvt. \n\nA spokesman from the Ministry of Labour and Employment couldn\u2019t be immediately reached for comment.\n\nClose to a quarter of the workforce is employed in the formal sector, for which data is readily available through retirement plans and state-sponsored insurance.The government has also started polling companies to get more details on workers.\n\nThe bigger headache lies with drilling down the personal details of informal workers, including gender and age. To address this, the government launched an online portal known as e-Shram in August that makes workers eligible for insurance and other social security benefits in exchange for signing up with their personal details. So far, more than 100 million workers have signed up with 280 million left to go.\n\nThe government plans to make the social security benefits from this website transferable when a worker shifts to the formal sector or to a new location, the people said. Most workers will sign up for this by next year and details of the first-ever surveys capturing the distribution of domestic workers and socio-economic conditions of migrant workers will also be available by then, they said.\n\nRead More News onindiaministry of labour and employmentnarendra modijobs data(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

Is it a good buying opportunity?Axis Bank trades at 30% discount to ICICI. Analysts see up to 64% upsideNEW DELHI: Sansera Engineering, a manufacturer of critical precision forged and machined components, is likely to provide the much needed alpha to your portfolio amid a range-bound market and high stock valuations.\n\nThe counter could surge up to 50 per cent from current levels, said the first initiation of coverage on Sansera Engineering by Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities. The brokerage house has given a target of Rs 1,184 in the next 12 months.\n\nThe company got listed in September and has gained over 6 per cent. However, it is trading below the listing price of Rs 811. But things could change soon for the stock.\n\nSiddhartha Bera, an analyst with Nomura, says the company is in the process of transforming into a diversified play on high-quality parts across several new segments like aerospace, electric vehicles, rotor and braking.\n\nThe company already has strong in-house engineering, design and machine building capabilities. It is the largest supplier of connecting rods in India and among the top 10 globally. The segment contributed about 40 per cent of FY21 revenue.\n\nAuto industry commentators have said the two-wheeler and passenger vehicle (PV) segments in India and the PV industry globally will require much faster model cycles as competition heats up and the EV/hybrid mix rises. These new models will also require new lightweight materials and much higher tolerance.\n\n\u201cWe believe Sansera is well positioned to benefit from this scenario as the management has been building internal capabilities to partner with OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) right from the design stage, forge new materials, and quickly set up efficient lines due to its machine building skills,\u201d says Bera.\n\nEarly signs of success are already visible, say analysts.\n\nSansera has received orders with peak annual revenue of Rs 1,250 crore, spread across tech-agnostic/EV and non-auto. Nomura expects the revenue mix to diversify from 83 per cent in the ICE segment in FY21 to 69 per cent by FY24, while tech-agnostic/non-auto share should increase to 12 per cent/19 per cent from 5 per cent/12 per cent in FY21.\n\nThe broker says financial ratios, top line and bottom line will improve in tandem. \u201cWe expect ROE to improve to 23 per cent by FY24 from 13 per cent in FY21. We expect Sansera to deliver 26 per cent revenue CAGR and 44 per cent PAT CAGR over FY22-24,\u201d Bera says.\n\nThe impressive growth possibility makes it a long-term bet, say analysts. As the company demonstrates its EPS growth driven by new-order wins in non-auto/EVs and hybrids, many expect a significant re-rating. Historically, Sansera has grown well ahead of peers.\n\n\u201cWith the auto component industry expected to grow over the next few years on the back of OEM demand, well diversified business model and strong financial performance above industry trends, the outlook of the stock remains constructive and therefore investors can hold this stock for a long term,\u201d says Likhita Chepa, Senior Research Analyst at CapitalVia Global Research.\n\nIn the second quarter, the company reported a profit growth of 11 per cent while revenue climbed 25 per cent year-on-year. Ebitda margin for Q2FY22 stood at 20.1 per cent.\n\nBR Preetham, Group CEO of Sansera Engineering, says: \u201cWe are in the process of setting up a dedicated facility for hybrid and electric components at one of our plants in Bangalore and a new plant for aerospace & defense. The plants are expected to be commissioned during FY22. In the long term, the company is targeting an enhanced revenue base with auto ICE contributing about 60 per cent, auto-tech agnostic & xEV contributing 15 per cent and the remaining 25 per cent being non-auto.\u201d\n\nPick the best companies to investBECOME AN ETPRIME MEMBERRead More News onStock to buySansera EngineeringSansera Engineering share priceStock Ideastock to buy todaySansera Engineering stock(What's moving Sensex and  Nifty  Track  latest market news,  stock tips and  expert advice on  ETMarkets.

        "Article": "SynopsisFor instance, in case of a salaried individual, one can evaluate the salary structure offered by the employer and opt for those salary components which help maximise tax benefits.Getty ImagesHere is a look at 9 ways one can save income tax and improve one's overall financial fitness.\n\n1.Investment in tax-saving instruments\nTo encourage saving by citizens, the government has provided certain tax deductions on the amounts invested in specified instruments under section 80C of the Income-tax Act, 1961. Some of the popular specified investment instruments for the purpose of tax planning are:\n\n\nEmployees' Provident Fund (EPF) \nPublic Provident Fund (PPF)\nFixed deposits (tenure of 5 years or more)\nLife insurance policies\nELSS mutual funds\nNational Pension Scheme (NPS) and other pension plans\nInvesting in these instruments wisely can serve the dual purpose of meeting financial goals and tax savings (up to an investment limit of Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year) concurrently. However, tax savings will be available only if an individual opts for the old tax regime. If one opts for the new tax regime, which offers concessional tax rates, one will have to forgo many of the tax deductions and exemptions available under the old tax regime like the section 80C benefit. For those who have opted for the new tax regime, investments in the above the instruments will only help in achieving their financial goals and not in tax savings. \n\n\n2.Selection of appropriate components in the salary structure offered by employer\nIn case of a salaried individual, one can evaluate the salary structure offered by the employer and opt for those salary components which help maximise tax benefits. For example, one can opt for House Rent Allowance (HRA) in case they are paying rent, telephone/ internet expense reimbursements, education allowance, food coupons etc. Accordingly, one can claim appropriate deductions/exemptions while computing taxable income (as per the specified conditions).\n\n3. Increase in retirement fund contribution\nSalaried individuals can look at making additional contribution towards 'Voluntary Provident Fund' in addition to EPF, if the investment limit of Rs 1.5 lakh is not exhausted. This additional contribution will also be deductible from taxable income subject to conditions. Further, the employer's contribution to NPS (subject to 10% of salary) will provide an additional deduction to the employee.\n\nHowever, do keep in mind that employee's own contribution to EPF and VPF should not exceed Rs 2.5 lakh in a financial year or else income tax will be payable on the interest accretion on the excess provident fund contributions.\n\n\n4. Tax benefits on a home loanIf a housing loan is availed from a financial institution such as bank or NBFC or housing finance company to acquire/ construct a house property, then the interest and principal paid on the loan taken can be claimed as a deduction from taxable income, subject to specified limits under the tax provisions. However, the tax savings can be claimed only if old tax regime is opted for. Do keep in mind that the deduction on principal repayment amount is subject to the overall Rs 1.5 lakh limit under Section 80C.\n\n\n5. Protecting oneself with health insurance Income tax provisions provide for deductions against premiums paid towards health insurance for self, spouse, dependent children and dependent parents. Hence, one can buy health insurance for oneself and family members to help manage medical expenses in case of health emergencies and at the same time, avail tax benefits for premium paid towards these policies (Rs 25,000 for self, spouse and dependent children; Rs 50,0000 for senior citizen parents, as applicable).\n\nSimilarly, if senior citizens are not covered under any health insurance policy, then also they can claim deduction of up to Rs 50,000 for medical expenses made during the year.\n\n\n6. Claiming appropriate deduction for medical expenses, tuition fees etc.It is important to note that in certain instances even if one doesn't make any additional investment, tax benefits can be availed in connection with certain expenditures incurred like Rs 5,000 for preventive health check-ups. However, the deduction for expenditure on health check up is subject to the overall limit under section 80D which includes the health insurance premiums mentioned above. Also, parents can claim a tax deduction of up to Rs 1.5 lakh under section 80C (under the overall limit of Rs 1.5 lakh) for the tuition fee paid for their children's education.\n\n\n7. Filing of tax returns within the specified timelines The importance of filing income tax returns and other statutory forms (as applicable in one's case) within the specified timelines cannot be emphasised enough. The same assists in setting up a proper tax record for any enquiry/ verification by the tax authorities. Further, filed income tax returns (ITR) are also required to be submitted for various purposes like applying for immigration documents, housing loans, carry forward of losses, certain high value transactions etc. Hence, it is important to file one's ITR within the set timelines to avoid interest/ penal implications.\n\n\n8. New concessional tax regime A new simplified optional personal income tax regime has been introduced by the government from FY 2020-21 onwards.\n\nSubject to certain conditions, an individual or HUF will have the option to pay taxes at reduced slab rates which are applicable without certain exemptions and deductions. In view of the same, one can compare tax payable under the existing and new tax regime and opt for the regime which is more beneficial from tax perspective.\n\n\n9. Documentation requirementsWhile no documents are required to be uploaded while e-filing ITR, one should maintain adequate record of documents for investments made like PF account statements, passbooks, copies of insurance policies, pension plans, bank statements etc. for a hassle-free interaction with the relevant authorities.\n\n\n(The author is Partner & India Mobility leader - People Advisory Services, EY.

I would go for ICICI, HDFC Bank and maybe Kotak Bank in that order. \u201dETMarkets.comRelatedNifty to lag broader market; time to avoid financial and FMCG stocks: Shankar SharmaIt is better to be in largecap stocks than midcaps now: Rahul ShahAbhishek Basumallick is confident of 18-20% return with a 3 year plus horizon. Here\u2019s why\"PSU banks still remain a value buy and the market is not in a mood to buy value at this point of time. Apart from SBI, most other banks are trading at a discount to the price to book. They are trading at less than one time,\" says Dipan Mehta, Director, Elixir Equities.\n\n\nThe Bank Nifty has underperformed despite blockbuster earnings and credit growth coming back. But first let us talk about HDFC Ltd.We are very positive on HDFC. It is a stock which should be there in every portfolio as part of the core holdings. In the last couple of quarters, the numbers have been very impressive and despite the size, they are able to maintain the momentum as far as their credit growth is concerned. Now with the real estate market picking up, there will be a lot of opportunities for large companies like HDFC to expand their credit book and grow at a slightly faster pace as well. \n\nAnd of course, the lending standards are exceptional as is their collection mechanism. We need to go towards safety in the market and largecap companies. HDFC completely fits that particular bill and checks all the boxes over there. So in terms of valuation and in terms of the kind of subsidiaries which they have done and the value they have created, keeping all of that in mind we are very positive on HDFC. Those who are invested should remain invested. From time to time, corrections come in the market, which would be a good entry point for HDFC. But even at these levels, HDFC is a good value buy. \n\n\nWhich horse would you pick among private sector banks? Are you comfortable with valuations as they stand right now?I believe one should have a slightly safer strategy and keeping that in mind, within the banking space, go for the bluest of blue chip companies. I would go for ICICI, HDFC Bank and maybe Kotak Bank in that order. \n\nThere is a lot of value in some of the PSU banks led by SBI and then the tier-2 banks like IndusInd, Federal Bank, IDFC First are also interesting. But we are seeing ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank gain market share. Certainly their internal systems, lending standards, the way NPAs have been provided for, offer a lot more comfort. \n\nAs we expect the market to correct a little bit more from these levels, we think that the likes of ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Kotak Bank would do far better than some of the tier-2 banks. So, we are very positive about these banks. There is value generated in their subsidiary companies as well and we are comfortable as far as the price to book or price to earnings multiples are concerned.\n\n\nWhat about the public sector banks because we had seen a run up there as well?PSU banks still remain a value buy and the market is not in a mood to buy value at this point of time. We are learning that despite such exceptional numbers coming across the board from PSU banks on account of lower provisioning and despite their stressed asset problems being largely over, apart from SBI, most other banks are trading at a discount to price to book. They are trading at less than one time. \n\nOne could expect trading rallies from time to time. One may have to be a bit patient and may get some amount of outperformance, but largely over a three, five year period I do not think PSU banks will outperform like HDFC Banks and some of the other private sector banks. \n\nSo it is a bit of a mixed picture as far as PSUs are concerned and one cannot buy them at these levels because they are largely underperforming but the existing investors should remain invested as they may get good dividend yields and eventually one could expect a mild increase in their price to book or whatever valuation ratio the market is tracking them at. But I am not convinced that these are great long term plays.\n\nPick the best companies to investBECOME AN ETPRIME MEMBERRead More News onICICI Bank | HDFC Bank | Kotak Mahindra Bankdipan mehtavalue investingstock marketbank stocksbank stocks to buy(What's moving Sensex and  Nifty  Track  latest market news,  stock tips and  expert advice on  ETMarkets.

        "Article": "SynopsisUS soybean shipments to China in 2020-21 were the strongest since the 2016-17 season, thanks in part to a delayed start to the 2021 Brazil export season that helped extend US sales.iStockChinese soybean importers have nearly completed December purchases, and are now filling January and February needs just as the Brazilian export season ramps up, according to a U.S. exporter.BEIJING/CHICAGO: China's soybean imports from the United States in 2021/22 are expected to fall sharply from last season after loading delays following Hurricane Ida. An early 2022 Brazil soy crop also shortened the U.S. export window to China, the world's top soybean buyer.\n\nChina's total imports of U.S. soybeans for the marketing year that started on Sept. 1 may drop by at least 20% to less than 30 million tonnes, according to analysts and top importers.\n\nU.S. farmers have just gathered their second largest soybean crop in history, and typically export around 45-50% of annual output.\n\nMore than half of those sales tend to go to China, which in turn makes around 70% of its U.S. soybean deals during the post-harvest window from September through December.\n\nBut this year the aftermath of Hurricane Ida - which hobbled crop-loading at key U.S. ports for several days in September - resulted in an 81% drop in China-bound shipments that month from the year before, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.\n\nFurther, the main drivers of China's soy demand - crushing and hog production margins - hit a soft patch right during the peak U.S. harvest window, blunting China's appetite for U.S. supplies.\n\nU.S. loadings picked up sharply in October to over 10 million tonnes, according to Refinitiv data, but now face the prospect of an earlier-than-usual start to the 2022 export season out of Brazil, the world largest soy producer.\n\n\"The U.S. (soybean) export season had a bad start this year. Crush margins were low and demand was not good at that time,\" said Bai Jie, analyst with COFCO futures.\n\n\"Then there was the impact from Hurricane Ida. And some U.S. market share was squeezed by Brazilian beans,\" Bai said.\n\nDOWNSIDE\nU.S. soybean shipments to China in 2020-21 were the strongest since the 2016-17 season, thanks in part to a delayed start to the 2021 Brazil export season that helped extend U.S. sales.\n\n\"American beans won't have such opportunity in the coming months, as planting of Brazilian beans is fast this year, meaning there will be ample beans to be shipped to China in the first quarter of 2022,\" said Zou Honglin, analyst with the agriculture division of Mysteel, a China-based commodities consultancy.\n\nU.S. soybeans have also faced price headwinds, with export offers trading fairly close to those out of Brazil, where freight costs to China are lower.\n\nIn addition, Brazilian soybeans offer better crush margins for Chinese soy processors, thanks to higher average protein levels in Brazilian soybeans. Margins for U.S. soybeans shipped out of the Pacific Northwest for February delivery are at about 500 yuan ($78.49) per tonne, compared with 684 yuan for Brazilian beans, according to Mysteel.\n\n\"Brazilian beans are just cheaper, and price is king,\" said an Asia-based trader with a top trading house.\n\n\n\"WINDOW IS CLOSING\"\nChinese soybean importers have nearly completed December purchases, and are now filling January and February needs just as the Brazilian export season ramps up, according to a U.S. exporter.\n\nJanuary soybean shipments from the Gulf Coast were offered around $500 per tonne FOB late last month, with an additional $78 or $80 per tonne for freight to China. Brazilian soybeans are around $520 per tonne FOB, with freight of around $60 per tonne, he said.\n\n\"It's been a little disappointing from a U.S. perspective. Brazil's been wedging into our export window a little more every year,\" the exporter said. \"Our window is closing.\"\n\nChina's soybean arrivals in November-December will mainly be U.S. cargoes, but Brazilian shipments are expected to rise sharply during January-March to over 6 million tonnes, according to Mysteel's Zou.\n\nThat would mark a more than four-fold rise from the 1.35 million tonnes during the first quarter of 2021.\n\nWith China expected to account for nearly 60% of all soybean imports this season, U.S. exporters will not be able to find a single large buyer to replace it. Europe, Mexico, Argentina, Egypt and Thailand are the next five largest importers, according to the USDA, but collectively buy only a third of China's total.\n\n\nPROTEIN POWER\nHog production margins will be a key determinant of final soy demand in China next year. A surge in its pork output in 2021 caused margins to collapse to record lows, slashing the sector's appetite for soymeal feed. But a recovery in pork prices and hog margins is now underway, and if sustained will lift total soy consumption.\n\nHowever, with Brazilian beans boasting higher protein content anyway, South American exporters stand to benefit most from any further climbs in demand.\n\n\"Pressure for American beans would only grow going forward, as long as weather in South America remains normal,\" said a soymeal trader in Shandong province, a major livestock producer in China.\n\nRead More News onChina ExportssoybeansexportimportsshipmentscofcoHurricane Ida(The one-stop destination for MSME, ET RISE provides news, views and analysis around GST, Exports, Funding, Policy and small business management.)

Here\u2019s why\"I would like to be positioned on the safer side and although the markets have rallied in the last two, three days, we should expect a resumption of the correction. Eventually our target is that the 200 day moving average should get tested within the next few weeks and that is about 16,200 or thereabouts on the Nifty,\" says Dipan Mehta, Director, Elixir Equities.\n\n\nL&T is getting into a partnership with ReNew for hydrogen and this is something that a number of players including Reliance Industries are very interested in. How quickly can this translate into real business opportunity?It is a bit difficult to say at this point of time because these plans are very much in the future. Investors are more focussed on which sectors are doing well and whether with the advent of the new coronavirus variant, they should still pursue the unlock trade or move to safety. Those are the real issues at hand rather than some long term investments which Tatas or Reliance may make.\n\n\nWe still do not know enough at this stage with regard to the Omicron variant and the jury is out as to how virulent it is. How does one position in the market with so many unknowns?We are entering uncertain territory as far as this particular variant is concerned but that is not really my concern as far as the markets go. It is more to do with the kind of inflation which we have seen and the impact it has had on operating profit margins. Therefore the earnings season was a bit of a disappointment and we are not seeing abatement of supply chain issues. \n\nSo keeping that in mind, I would get a bit cautious and go for good long-term safe stocks at this point of time. Our preference would be in software as well as pharmaceutical companies, especially the Nifty stocks within those segments. Technically in terms of liquidity and overall market sentiment as well as the way the IPOs are coming, I would like to be positioned on the safer side and expect that although the markets have rallied in the last two, three days, we should expect a resumption of the correction. Eventually our target is that the 200 day moving average should get tested within the next few weeks and that is about 16,200 or thereabouts on the Nifty. That is the point we feel would provide some margin of safety and a good entry point for investors who are waiting on the sidelines.\n\n\nWe have been hearing about capital reallocation taking place from primary markets and the cash markets to F&O etc. As far as IPOs go, what is your advice for clients?We need to be selective about IPOs and clearly the valuations are higher for the companies coming in the IPO market. In fact, valuations for similar businesses are available cheaper in the listed space. But if it is a concept stock, one of its kind and provides a very nice exposure to a micro investment theme, then one could pursue that even at a higher price to earnings multiple like we have seen in the case of Zomato as well as Nykaa, two outstanding companies which have got a slightly differentiated business model.\n\nSo we need to be a bit selective and I would go for companies where the whole concept is completely new or they are the market leaders and although we may get in at a slightly expensive side, one can expect these stocks to do really well over the three to five year period. Typically, we and our investors are long term in nature and do not mind holding stocks for three to five years. So we need to be a bit selective. By and large, as a thumb rule I think IPOs are on the expensive side.\n\nPick the best companies to investBECOME AN ETPRIME MEMBERRead More News onniftysensex nowsensexnifty newsnifty stocksstock marketshare market(What's moving Sensex and  Nifty  Track  latest market news,  stock tips and  expert advice on  ETMarkets.

advanced from the House.Getty ImagesThe US Congress approved a stopgap funding bill Thursday in a rare show of cross-party unity to keep federal agencies running into 2022 and avert a costly holiday season government shutdown.\n\nWith the clock ticking down to the 11:59 pm Friday deadline, the Senate voted by 69 to 28 to keep the lights on until February 18 with a resolution that had already advanced from the House.\n\nThe \"continuing resolution\" avoids millions of public workers being sent home unpaid with Christmas approaching, as parks, museums and other federal properties and services closed.\n\n\"I am glad that, in the end, cooler heads prevailed -- the government will stay open,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said.\n\n\"And I thank the members of this chamber for walking us back from the brink of an avoidable, needless and costly shutdown.\"\n\nCongress watchers had expected to see the resolution getting a rough ride in the Senate, where a small group of hardline Republicans threatened to tank the measure in protest over the White House's pandemic response.\n\nBut Democrats agreed to allow a straight majority vote on defunding President Joe Biden's vaccine-or-testing mandate for large companies, which promptly failed as expected.\n\nThe right-wing Republican group, led by Utah's senior senator Mike Lee, argues that the mandate is an assault on personal liberty.\n\nThe pandemic has killed more than 780,000 people in the United States and the troubling new Omicron variant of the coronavirus has raised fears of a winter surge in cases.\n\nBut legal challenges have mounted against Biden's edict requiring vaccination or weekly tests for some sections of the US workforce, including companies with more than 100 employees.\n\nLee had campaigned to remove federal funding to implement the mandate and was backed by right wingers in both chambers.\n\n\"If the choice is between temporarily suspending non-essential functions on the one hand and, on the other hand, standing idle as up to 45 million Americans lose their jobs, their livelihoods and their ability to work, I'll stand with American workers every time,\" he said.\n\nThe figure Lee cited would represent more than a quarter of the 157 million people that make up the US workforce, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nOnly five percent of unvaccinated adults say they have left a job due to a vaccine mandate, according to an October survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nIn the evenly divided upper chamber, any single senator can torpedo any vote.\n\nBut the majority of Senate Republicans -- including their leader Mitch McConnell -- were against the move, fearing they would be blamed for a shutdown.\n\nAhead of the House vote McConnell had indicated that Republicans would support the continuing resolution, although he gave no indication that he bring Lee and the other hold-outs to heel.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi, the most senior Democrat in the House of Representatives, earlier hit out at Lee and his backers, accusing them of \"defiance of science and public health.\"\n\nIf Congress had failed to keep the government open, the closures would have begun just after midnight on Saturday and would likely have bled into the following week.\n\nThere has never been a shutdown during a national emergency such as the pandemic, but the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the 2018-19 stoppage wiped $11 billion from the economy.\n\nThe stopgap measure buys legislators time to negotiate full-year spending bills for the rest of fiscal 2022.\n\nAnd with the threat of a shutdown off the table, Democratic leadership is now free to focus on passing Biden's domestic agenda -- a $1.8 trillion social welfare and climate spending plan.\n\nThe bill is central to Biden's legacy, but risks failing because of feuding between the Democrats' progressive and centrist factions.\n\nLawmakers are also deadlocked over the prospect of a first-ever US debt default that would erase an estimated six million jobs and wipe out $15 trillion of household wealth, tanking the economy.\n\nThe government is likely to run out of cash on or soon after December 15, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned, unless Congress raises the federal borrowing cap.\n\nBut Republicans say they won't help, despite having pressed for hikes under former president Donald Trump, because they want no part in the Democrats' historically large package of social reforms.\n\nRead More News onUS Congressgovernment shutdownChristmasWhite Housepandemic(Catch

        "Article": "SynopsisNilekani talked about three developments which are going to have an impact on India's growth and economic recovery.Nandan Nilekani explained that users will be empowered with their own data and there will be many use cases for that, the first big being lending.It\u2019s a no-brainer that the digital acceleration in India because of the Covid-19 has created tremendous growth opportunities for India\u2019s technology companies. Holding the same thought, Nandan Nilekani, non-executive chairman of Infosys said that the number of people working in IT services and BPO industry is estimated to double in the next couple of years to around 9-10 million.\n\nTalking about how India is at a really bright spot in the digital story, Nilekani explained three developments which are going to have an impact on India's growth and economic recovery.\n\nStarting with the growth of technology companies in India, he said, \u201cPeople like Satya Nadella have said that the world spending on technology is going to move from 5% of GDP to 10% of GDP globally in the next decade or so. Which means there's going to be a huge amount of investment of technology and people into digital transformation. And in India, Indian companies are benefiting from that.\u201d\n\nHe also hailed the growing amount of activity in the startup ecosystem in the country, which is also leading to massive job opportunities in the tech industry.\n\n\nAlso read: \nWhy the Account Aggregator framework can be SME\u2019s UPI\n\u201cThere's a huge amount of activity in the startup ecosystem and it's estimated that the number of people in the IT services and BPO industry are about 4.5 million, and that is expected to double in the next several years. Imagine, it took us about 14 years to get to about 4.5 million people, but doubling that to 9-10 million will happen in maybe a decade,\u201d he said at ASCENT eConclave.\n\nHe added that in the tech industry, every job recruiter creates four or five jobs in ancillary industries, such as transportation, food, and real estate.\n\nAdding to India\u2019s encouraging digital story, he said that India has the best digital public infrastructure in the world. Nilekani, who headed the project of UIDAI, proudly talked about the impact of creating almost 1.3 billion digital identities and the success of UPI.\n\n\u201cThe UPI was launched barely five years back in May 2016. By October 2016, it reached about 100,000 transactions. However, in October, it did over 4.3 billion transactions and has a total transaction value of $100 billion. So, this has had a dramatic impact. Today, when I go out, every vegetable seller, every coconut seller, every small shop is taking UPI payments, and that's really been a revolution,\u201d he said.\n\nThe third development he mentioned, which will also impact the recovery, is the account aggregator network. He explained that users will be empowered with their own data and there will be many use cases for that, the first big being lending.\n\n\u201cBorrowers, big businesses or individuals will be able to use their own digital footprint and get access to credit. So, if I'm a small business, I can use the data of my purchases, or my sales or my taxes paid and share the data with the lender securely. And the lender can make an instant decision to give me a loan. Right now, that system is doing a few 1000 transactions, but there's no reason why in a few years, it won't do millions of transactions in a day,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that this will completely change the economy because unlike in the old model where a few large companies got credit with this model, every small kirana store or a dispensary, or manufacturing company, will get credit. This, in turn, will drive job creation and economic growth.\n\nRead More News onnandan nilekanitechnologyit serviceskirana storesatya nadellainfosyseconomic recoveryASCENT eConclaveupi paymentsdigitalApply for ETRise Top MSMEs Ranking.

AgenciesThe Korean version of \"Money Heist\" will be produced by BH Entertainment and Contents Zium.LOS ANGELES: \"Money Heist\" may be getting over on Netflix but a spin-off show, centring on popular character Berlin, is already being developed at the streaming service. Netflix has officially ordered the spin-off project which will see actor Pedro Alonso returning to play Andres de Fonollosa aka Berlin. \n\nTitled \"Berlin\", the show is set to launch in 2023, reported Deadline. \n\nBerlin is one of the most popular-yet-polarising characters from \"Money Heist\", known as \"La Casa De Papel\" in Spanish. \n\nFans have found him to be quite charming, clever, funny and attractive but deep down, he is misogynistic and violent man, who is also a sexual predator. \n\nThere are no details about the new show's plot and how the makers plan to bring Berlin back as the character had died towards the end of season two of \"Money Heist\". \n\nThe news of the spin-off comes as \"Money Heist\" is ending with its last five episodes dropping on December 3. \n\nThe Netflix series traces two heists pulled off by a ragtag group of thieves, led by the enigmatic The Professor (Alvaro Morte) -- one on the Royal Mint of Spain, and one on the Bank of Spain. \n\nThe fifth and final season of the popular Spanish series has been divided into two parts of five episodes each. The first five had debuted on Netflix on September 3. \n\nMeanwhile, the Korean adaptation of \"Money Heist\" will feature \"Squid Game\" star Park Hae-soo as Berlin. \n\nThe Korean adaptation of \"Money Heist\" will be directed by Kim Hong-sun, who has helmed TV dramas like 'The Guest\" and \"Voice\". \n\nRyu Yong-jae and his team, whose credits include the Netflix original series \"My Holo Love\" and tvN series \"Psychopath Diary\", will pen the 12-episode show. \n\nHae-Soo found global fame earlier this year after playing the role of Cho Sang-woo in hit dystopian drama series \"Squid Game\". \n\nThe Korean version of \"Money Heist\" will be produced by BH Entertainment and Contents Zium. \n\n\n\n\nRead More News onMoney Heist Korean versionMoney HeistKorean Money HeistPedro AlonsoBerlinAndres de FonollosaDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

The term has caused unnecessary harassment of the private channels, the panel said, recommending that the term may be properly defined to remove any ambiguity in the interpretation of the term in the prescribed code. The ministry, however, had submitted that 'anti-national' is commonly understood as opposed to national interests or nationalism.\n\nTV channels, including those broadcasting news are required to comply with the Programme and Advertising Code laid down by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting under the Cable Television Network Rules.\n\nThe discussion on the matter specifically came up in March last year when the parliamentary ministry asked I&B ministry officials to respond why prohibitory orders were passed against two malayalam channels in a circular that had the phrase \"anti-national attitude.\" The panel asked the officials what was their intention to include the phrase. The report mentioned that the I&B secretary had informed the committee that the decision was taken at a level far higher than him.\n\nThe I&B ministry has also told the panel that it is considering changes in the present regulatory environment for media, and after introducing amendments in the Press and Registration of Books Act, 1867 and the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995, it is also looking at the possibilities of an umbrella Statute for the entire broadcasting sector covering print, electronic and online media.\n\n The panel also asked for a proper execution of the IT (Guidelines for Intermediaries and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021' that is presently being challenged in courts.\n\nRead More News onpress council of indiatrpparliamentary ministryshashi tharoor(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 1.3%, dragged by big tech names. MSCI's index of Asia shares outside Japan fell 0.7%.\n\n The risk-sensitive Australian dollar fell 0.3% and at just below 71 cents is close to a one-year low.\nStock Analysis \u2013 Know before investing\n                            Stock score of  Dollar Industries Ltd  moved up by 1 in a month on a 10-point scale.\n                        \n                        Subscribe Now\n                    Exclusively forStock Analysis \n                    Stock score of Dollar Industries Ltd is 8 on a scale of 10.\n                View Stock Analysis\u00a0\u00bb\n Didi ran afoul of Chinese regulators by pushing ahead with its $4.4 billion U.S. IPO in July and said on Weibo it was looking to move its listing to Hong Kong.\n\n \"Delistings starting to happen gives some jitters over the uncertainty as to how this impacts on the broader U.S.-China picture,\" said Bank of Singapore analyst Moh Siong Sim.\n\n The news about Didi comes a day after Singapore-based ride-hailing and delivery firm Grab slid more than 20% on its Nasdaq debut. The listing is the biggest on Wall Street by a Southeast Asian firm.\n\n More broadly markets have lurched around on little hard news about Omicron this week, driving the CBOE volatility index toward its biggest one-week leap since the pandemic chaos of February 2020. Short-term yields have also jumped as investors bet on higher rates, even with the Omicron uncertainty.\n\n Traders will need to wait at least another week or so for an early read on the variant's virulence or vaccine resistance. U.S. labour data due later on Friday is also in focus as a guide to rates.\n\n Benchmark brent crude futures finished higher overnight at $69.67 a barrel, but have dropped more than 3% this week and are down more than 18% from October's three-year high.\n\n So far, in the absence of Omicron details some governments have scrambled to shut borders anyway. But other policymakers - most notably the Federal Reserve - are cautiously proceeding apace with plans to move away from crisis-mode responses.\n\n Fed Chair Jerome Powell said central bankers will talk about a faster pullback to bond buying at this month's meeting and stop describing inflation as transitory. Oil cartel OPEC is going ahead with planned production increases.\n\n \"The Fed is not ignoring the threat from Omicron, but are choosing not to let it delay policy responses that suggest a more business as usual outlook,\" said Commonwealth Bank of Australia strategist Tobin Gorey.\n\n \"OPEC+ has done a similar thing,\" he added. \"Neither has iced their planned policy changes...and both are perhaps examples that suggest lockdown responses to epidemic surges are becoming less likely.\"\n\n The bond market's response to Powell's hawkish shift has been to jack up short term rates and push down long ones, reckoning that sooner hikes will end up curbing future inflation and growth, and sharply flattening the U.S. yield curve.\n\n Two-year Treasury yields were steady in early Asia trade for a weekly gain of nearly 10 basis points.\n\n Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields, on the other hand, have dropped nearly 6 bps to 1.4291% this week and 30-year yields are down 7.3 bps to 1.7545%.\n\n \"It's inflation, not growth, which is making the Fed accelerate tightening plans,\" said Kit Juckes, a strategist at Societe Generale in London.\n\n \"For the first time in ages, the risk to this U.S. economic cycle is that it comes to an end sooner than consensus forecasts expect,\" he said, forecasting that the U.S. dollar's upward momentum could slow into a peak around the middle of next year.\n\n Investors sold riskier currencies on Friday. The risk-sensitive Australian and New Zealand dollars lost about 0.3% each.

The bureaucracy must be creative and think out of the box, the court has said.\n\n\"You are doing everything but nothing is happening on the ground,\" the CJI has said. \"This is an emergency situation and you must act in a creative way,\" the CJI said again on Thursday.\n\nThe bench has earlier spoken of the need to undertake scientific studies to work out a long-term solution while urgent steps were taken to ease the situation in the interim.\n\nThe government insists that it is going by the book. It has banned all construction except essential activities, such as metro, railways and airports, and asked industries to shift to environment friendly alternative fuel.\n\nThe government is also actively pushing work from home and car-pooling to curb vehicular traffic, a major contributor to air pollution.\n\nStudies have identified industry, vehicular pollution and dust as major contributors. The contribution of stubble burning is less in most months but climbs to nearly 30% in the post-harvest months.\n\n\n Delhi Schools Closed; Boards, Online Classes to ContinueThe Delhi government on Thursday announced the closure of all schools in the national capital till further orders because of an increase in the air pollution levels.\n\n However, board exams will continue as scheduled and teaching-learning activities will be conducted online, it said.\n\n The decision came hours after the Supreme Court pulled up the Delhi government for resuming physical classes in schools despite an increase in the air pollution levels in the city. \n\n\nRead More News onair pollutionsupreme courtncrcji nv ramanadelhiDelhi air pollution(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

He addressed a gathering in Ramban on Thursday in which he accused New Delhi of not trusting muslims.\n\n\u201cWe don't need tutorials on nationalism. New Delhi should stand by its promises made at the time of accession\u2026,\u201d said Abdullah in the rally.\n\nOver the last few weeks, another former chief minister of J&K, PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti, held public meetings in the Gool, RS Pora, Bishnah and Kishtwar areas of Jammu.\n\n\u201cPDP was weakened by creating proxy parties which everyone is aware about. Then they created fissures within the NC in Jammu and those leaders directly joined the BJP,\u201d Mufti told reporters at a function recently. Mufti said the Congress is being targeted and the BJP is trying to create two factions within that party as well. \n\nRecently, over 20 Congress members in J&K resigned from the party. They are said to be close to former Rajya Sabha opposition leader Ghulam Nabi Azad. He has been conducting rallies and interacting independently in the Pir Panchal and Chenab regions. \n\nAzad\u2019s engagements have triggered rumors that a separate political platform under his leadership would emerge in J&K ahead of assembly polls. \n\nOn Wednesday, he has set off on a four-day tour of the Poonch-Rajouri region. He addressed a gathering in Poonch and interacted with people in Surankote and Rajouri as well. \"Article 370 is in court...We are 300 MPs short. I can't even say that in 2024 if Congress wins 300 MPs, we can do anything. God willing we will win but right now I don't see that happening. So, I don't want to make any false promises,\" Azad said in a rally in Poonch. In another rally in Surankote, Azad accused the BJP government of failing to protect jobs and lands of locals.\n\n\nThe J&K BJP\u2019s president, Ravinder Raina, recently concluded a three-day tour of Kupwara, where he asserted that his party would emerge as a majority party in the upcoming assembly elections and the next chief minister of J&K would be from their party as well.\n\n\u201cStatehood to the UT would be restored once J&K achieves normalcy, selective killings stop and a common man can move freely,\u201d J&K BJP\u2019s general secretary Ashok Koul said on the sidelines of a function in Bandipora of northern Kashmir. \n\nHe informed that the delimitation commission is due to submit its report before March 6 next year. \u201cBased on the report, 90 seats will go to polls immediately after the commission files the report,\u201d he was quoted as saying.\n\nRead More News onpeople s democratic partyJammu and KashmirUnion TerritoryMarchBJP(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

The CBI had sent handwriting samples of Deepak Goyal, a stenographer of co-accused advocate Gautam Khaitan, to ascertain the veracity of his handwriting on certain documents.\n\nThe probe agency had named both Khaitan and Goyal in its charge sheet in the case under the Prevention of Corruption Act and criminal conspiracy charges.\n\nThe FSL report has confirmed that the handwriting belongs to Goyal, said the people who spoke to ET.\n\nThe CBI had initially named Goyal a witness in its charge sheet filed in August 2017. But after subsequent investigation and based on new evidence, the agency converted him into an accused in its latest charge sheet filed in September last year.\n\nGoyal is alleged to have signed and forged key documents involved in the creation of shell companies. People in the know said Goyal also maintained a \u201crecord\u201d of alleged kickbacks received from middlemen and Interstellar Technologies, a Mauritius company which was allegedly used to park and launder kickbacks to VVIPs and influential persons in India to swing the helicopter deal in favour of UK\u2019s AgustaWestland. Goyal has denied the charges levelled against him.\n\nThe FSL report confirming Goyal\u2019s signature assumes significance since he is alleged to have played a \"key\" part in colluding with middlemen and co-accused in the laundering of kickbacks. His purported signature was also found in documents used to create shell companies to park alleged proceeds of crime.\n\nIn the charge sheet filed in September last year, the CBI had alleged that co-accused Rajiv Saxena, \u201cin collusion with Gautam Khaitan, received euro 12.40 million in the account of Interstellar Technologies from AgustaWestland, which was further routed/laundered in collusion with Deepak Goyal and other accused persons for paying the middleman and suspected public servants\u201d.\n\nA special CBI court has refused to grant any immediate relief to AgustaWestland International, which had sought discharge from the case, ET reported on Wednesday.\n\nThe court held that \u201cthere are allegations of conspiracy against accused persons including M/s AgustaWestland International Ltd UK \u2026 The prosecution is still in the process of supplying documents to the accused\u201d.\n\nThe court said: \u201cIn view of the given facts and circumstances, the application filed by M/s AgustaWestland UK shall be considered at the time of hearing arguments on charge.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, AgustaWestland was merged into Leonardo SpA (previously Finmeccanica) and is now the Italian parent\u2019s division under the Leonardo Helicopters brand.\n\nThe order further read: \u201cAs per CBI, supplementary charge sheet against some of the accused is yet to be filed and they have applied for sanction to prosecute some public servants and sanction to prosecute is still awaited.

The never-seen-before liquidity rush into the Indian market, both through private and public market deals, is a testament to the growing importance of the country in the playbook of global investors.\n\nSo far this year, private equity and venture capital funds have invested nearly $55 billion in Indian companies.\n\n\"We are looking at investing up to $1 billion in climate finance in India over the next five years. The capital will flow into climate mitigating projects and businesses to help the country get closer to its climate change targets,\" O'Donohoe said. Over the last four years, CDC has invested over $1 billion in climate finance across Africa and South Asia.\n\nFrom starting a renewable energy platform - Ayana Renewable Power - in 2018 with $100 million in commitments, CDC has gone on to invest in companies such as agri-tech firm CropIn and water treatment and management company Roserve ($10 million).\n\nIt has also extended debt funding of about $30 million to Tata Cleantech Capital, which in turn lends to businesses that focus on e-mobility solutions as well as water and energy efficiency across India.\n\nCDC Asia has closed over 20 commitments to a range of businesses and funds in India so far this year, including in Green Growth Equity Fund (GGEF), Fourth Partner Energy and follow-on investments in e-grocer BigBasket, among other leading consumer brands.\n\nApart from supporting companies directly, the development finance institution also invests as a limited partner, or LP, in India-focused early stage and growth stage VC and PE funds. It has backed funds such as Fearing Capital, Lighthouse Funds, Kotak PE, Aavishkaar and Lok Capital. At a time when early-stage investments are seeing an upsurge in the country, CDC is also ramping up its exposure to this asset class. \n\nFor early stage, CDC invests in new age economy companies through venture capital funds. \"CDC's Venture Capital programme has been active over the last 18 months. We have been increasingly backing more India-centric impact driven funds and will increase our pace of investment in this asset class going forward,\" O'Donohoe said.\n\nAccording to him, the unprecedented flush of liquidity in the startup ecosystem stems from strong fundamental growth in the Indian economy. \"We are believers in this growth story and will continue to back this with more investments going forward.\"\n\nIn India, CDC's early-stage investments have come across VC funds such as Chiratae Ventures IV, Stellaris II, 3one4 III. \"We also invested alongside our fund managers in companies such as Bizongo, Betterplace and Vayana Networks,\" said Srini Nagarajan, managing director and head of Asia at CDC.\n\n\nRead More News oncdcindiarenewablesclimate changeclimate investmentmodi(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

The cellular immunity in vaccinated persons could be crucial with the arrival of the Omicron variant.\n\n\"When a virus mutates, even if there are some changes in its structure - mostly seen in the Sars-Cov2 in its spike protein structure - other parts of the virus still remains the same. Our study shows that when a vaccinated person's T cells were confronted with such a variant, they were able to mount a response as they were primed for overall virus,\" Prof Pramod Kumar Garg, Executive Director of Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI) and lead author of the study, told ET.\n\nIt was too early to comment on vaccine efficacy against Omicron but \"it is likely that our body's T cells would be able to recognise the variant as they are already primed to the ancestral Wild type Sars-Cov2 virus. However, we will have to run tests to be certain of the assumption,\" he said.\n\nThe study - Effectiveness of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine against Sars-Cov-2 infection during Delta (B.1.617.2) variant surge in India: a test-negative, case-control study and a mechanistic study of post-vaccination immune responses - has found that two doses of Covishield vaccine were 63.1% effective against Sars-Cov-2 infection, caused mostly by the Delta variant, and prevented moderate-to- severe Covid-19 in 81.5% of cases.\n\nA Lancet commentary on the study said there was \"reduced antibody neutralisation but preserved T cell recognition of the Delta variant\" and how it raised questions on whether cellular immunity is a key factor in mitigating hospital admission and if low levels of neutralising antibodies can prevent severe disease.\n\nThe study said that it \"found no significant differences with regard to T-cell immune responses against wild-type or the Delta variant of Sars-Cov-2.\" It bases the assessment on the antigen-specific T cell responses it analysed in 59 vaccinated individuals.\n\n\"The mean IFN secretion was comparable across all variants of Sars-Cov-2\" with the exception of the Beta variant, where it was found significantly reduced compared with wild-type RBD. The difference was insignificant in case of Delta. IFNy or interferon gamma is secreted by T cells and plays a critical role in the immune system.\n\n\nRead More News ondeltacovidt cellsimmunitycovishield vaccineomicron variant(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

Industry executives said sales of smartphones, televisions, refrigerators and washing machines fell 15-20% sequentially in November due to surge in festive shopping in October, shortage of bestselling smartphone models and lower-than -expected off-take of wedding related purchases.\n\n\"November is traditionally a slower month as due to Diwali, there is a surge in consumption of home food and alternate food like chocolates that impacts sales of most packaged food. While we expect a revival from December onwards, the pace of growth may be slower than April-September,\" said Krishnarao Buddha, senior category head at biscuit maker Parle Products.\n\nSales decline was also due to an early festive season as October saw strong kirana orders, which expanded the base sequentially. However, FMCG expanded 10% compared to a year ago entirely driven by rural markets, as urban consumption fell both sequentially as well as over a year ago period.\n\n\n\n\"Excess stocks are still lying on shelves which will be liquidated before new stocks get billed, resulting in order decline in November,\" said Akshay D'Souza, chief of growth and insights at Mobisy Technologies, which owns Bizom. \"Packaged foods are seeing strong demand growth year-on-year driven by out-of-home consumption. The increase in people's mobility, higher travel services, return to work etc is helping drive higher consumption of ready to eat products,\"\n\nAs per Bizom data, packaged foods grew 32% during November against same month last year while beverages and commodity expanded 16% and 8% each.\n\nAngshu Mallick, chief executive of Adani Wilmar said despite inflation, there is a shift from unorganised market to branded as consumers prefer hygiene and trusted brands. \"Sales has been strong in both rural and urban. There are many essentials like rice or sugar where prices are either stable or falling, which has offset inflation in other commodities,\" Mallick added.\n\nElectronics segments declined even on a year-on-year basis as festive season, a key contributor of discretionary product sales, was in mid-November last year compared to 2021, when a bulk of the sales happened in last week of October. Market researcher IDC India research director Navkendar Singh said mobile sales in October were strong due to good brand and ecommerce offers, but both sales and shipments were slow in November with shortage of models across brands.\n\nElectronic and smartphone makers said if both the festive months of October and November are combined, it will reflect growth compared to a year ago.\n\n\"Festival calendar covers October and November months together and during this period, we have witnessed double-digit growth in sales, mainly driven by premium products. Post Diwali, November sales have been weak, but we expect the revival given the ongoing marriage season,\" said Deepak Bansal, vice president at LG Electronics India, the country's largest appliance maker.\n\nHowever, Godrej Appliances business head Kamal Nandi said there is an uncertainty amongst consumers with prices going up and emergence of the new covid variant dasmpening sentiments. \"We expect a recovery in the January-March quarter when the harvest money will come into the market and pre-summer purchases,\" he said.\n\n\nRead More News onfmcgbizomindiagroceriesomicronfestive seasoncovid(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

Those who import finished products have increased the volume of their order.\n\nSenior company executives said past experience has shown that countries such as China, Taiwan, Vietnam and Hong Kong can suddenly seal ports, airports or factories on detection of a new Covid variant. This plays havoc with the production and inventory management of companies, that are already grappling with shortage of components including semiconductors chips for the past several months. \n\nIndia\u2019s largest air-conditioner contract manufacturer, Amber Enterprises CEO Jasbir Singh said his company has just placed orders for an additional month of components to mitigate the impact of any cross-border trade restrictiopns .Amber manufactures AC for 22 brands, though fortunately for the company, its peak season is several months away.\n\nGodrej Appliances business head Kamal Nandi too said his company will increase the component holding period to two months instead of one. \u201cShipping rates could further go up and shortages can happen if the Omicron variant wreaks havoc. We don\u2019t want to take any chances\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier this week, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that the Omicron coronavirus variant poses a high risk of infection surges around the globe and could lead to severe consequences in some regions.

In December, our output will be 80-85% of planned production. But going forward it is difficult to say when things will normalise as the situation is extremely dynamic,\u201d he said.\n\nA senior executive with another Delhi-based carmaker said it is following all Covid-related protocols and watching out for directives from the government. \u201cAt our factories, we are making sure that all employees are double-vaccinated to minimize the impact in case there is any outbreak in India,\u201d he said.\n\nIndia\u2019s largest car maker Maruti Suzuki achieved 84% of its production target in November, compared to 60% in October and 40% in September.\n\nMarket researcher IDC India research director Navkendar Singh said while the January to March quarter is a lean period for smartphone sales, the new Covid variant can impact the launch and sales plans of new models. \u201cBrands may beef up inventories and components for these models since they all want to be cautious in their approach now,\u201d he said. \n\nAvneet Singh Marwah, chief executive of SPPL which sells Kodak, Thomson, Blaupunkt and Westinghouse electronic brands, said it has started to beef up supply chain.

As per the current rules, if an Indian resident buys shares in an unlisted company abroad, the foreign company cannot create any more step-down subsidiaries. This has proved to be a hindrance for Indian entrepreneurs looking to invest in foreign startups since it restricts the scalability of such companies.\n\nNow, the RBI is learnt to have given a recommendation to the finance ministry, saying if such step-down subsidiaries are being opened as part of genuine and 'bona fide' expansion plans of a company, the restriction should not be applied.\n\n\n\nConsultations with Industry \n Emails sent to the RBI and the finance ministry remained unanswered until press time.\n\n\"Indian tech entrepreneurs are constantly looking for acquisition opportunities especially in the other developing countries; however, current rules make it very difficult to make such investments,\" said a person cited above. \"These investments have potential to bring dollar money back into India if the business venture succeeds.\"\n\nThe RBI has held extensive consultations with the industry and the recommendations are based on inputs so received, said people cited above. Overseas investments by Indian residents fall under the ambit of the Liberalised Remittance Scheme. \"A natural outcome of growth is expansion and hence it is extremely important that the step-down subsidiaries restriction be reconsidered,\" said Moin Ladha, partner, Khaitan & Co. \"This will enable Indian investors to get the advantages associated with such diversification.\"\n\nAnother key recommendation pertains to purchase of shares of a foreign unlisted company. RBI is learnt to have recommended that any investment into unlisted foreign companies be considered a portfolio investment so long as the Indian owns less than 10% equity in the company. Portfolio investments enjoy liberal rules since they are meant for investment purposes only.\n\nCurrently, if an Indian buys shares of an unlisted foreign company, the company is presumed to be a joint venture. For instance, say an Indian 'A' buys a few shares of ByteDance - the parent of TikTok and an unlisted startup. Indian regulators presume that ByteDance is a JV where 'A' exerts some sort of control. Accordingly, 'A' is required to meet the steep compliance norms under the RBI rules.\n\nIn contrast, if 'A' had invested in shares of a foreign listed company, say Microsoft, it would have been considered a portfolio investment and would have been exempt from the compliance norms.\n\n\"It is impractical for a minority shareholder to be able to procure information or influence decisions of an overseas entity where they hold investment,\" said a person with direct knowledge of the matter. \"However, the current regime treats even a minority investment as setting up or acquiring a joint venture abroad.\"\n\nThe industry is also learnt to have requested the RBI to reconsider several more regulations. Most important of them all was a request to increase the cap on the LRS route. Currently under LRS, an Indian can remit a maximum of $250,000 per financial year. The industry suggested the same to be hiked to at least $350,000. However, the RBI has so far not acted on the input, people cited above said.\n\nUntil a few years ago, outward remittance rules used to be the policy domain of RBI under the Foreign Exchange and Management Act (Fema). In other words, RBI could tweak the rules on its own. However, in 2019 the Centre replaced Fema with Foreign Exchange Management (Non-Debt Instruments) or NDI rules, and currently, the policymaking part of the rules is in the hands of the finance ministry. The RBI has been assigned the role of administering the implementation of NDI rules.\n\n\nPick the best companies to investBECOME AN ETPRIME MEMBERRead More News oninvestmentRBIinvestingIndustryinvestmentsforeign companies(What's moving Sensex and  Nifty  Track  latest market news,  stock tips and  expert advice on  ETMarkets.

In partnership with the UK Revenge Porn Helpline, StopNCII.org builds on Meta's NCII Pilot, an emergency programme that allows potential victims to proactively hash their intimate images so they can't be proliferated on its platforms.\n\nIn India, the platform has partnered with organisations such as Social Media Matters, Centre for Social Research and Red Dot Foundation for the initiative.\n\nMeta also said the Women's Safety Hub initiative launched in Hindi and 11 other Indian languages will enable more female users in India to access information about tools and resources to enable a safe social media experience.\n\nBishakha Datta, executive editor, Point of View, and Jyoti Vadehra, head of media and communications at the Centre for Social Research, are the first Indian members on Meta's Global Women's Safety Expert Advisors group. The group also comprises 12 other non-profit leaders, activists and academic experts from different parts of the world.\n\nNain said India is an important market for the company and bringing Datta and Vadehra on board the advisory group will go a long way in further enhancing efforts to make the company's platforms safer for women in India. \n\n\"At Meta, building a safe online experience has been a priority and our commitment and efforts to keep women safe are industry leading. While we continue to build and invest to ensure online safety, the launch of these initiatives today is another step towards our commitment,\" said Nain. \n\n\"We are confident that with our ever-growing safety measures, women will be able to enjoy a social experience which will enable them to learn, engage and grow without any challenges,\" she added.\n\n\nRead More News onmetafacebookindiawomen safetlystopnciimeta pilot(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

Its Largecap Beater, which aims to give higher returns than large-cap funds, has Nifty 50 ETF, Nifty Next 50 ETF, Nifty Midcap 150 ETF, Gold ETF with weights ranging between 10% and 40% in the portfolio.\n\nPrabhudas Lilladher offers a dynamic multi-asset ETF portfolio through the PMS route for rich investors using a combination of international equities, debt split across liquid, corporate bond and gilt funds, and with weights in each product dynamically managed using an in-house model.\n\n\"Our multi-asset ETF strategy is dynamic and uses a tactical asset allocation strategy that uses a combination of our proprietary quant models and indicators,\" said Siddharth Vora, head-quant investment strategies & fund manager-PMS, at Prabhudas Lilladher. Vora said the model enables switching between domestic equities, international equities, gold, corporate bonds, gilt and liquid funds to generate a return. Currently the portfolio has 54.7 % domestic equity, 14.4% international equity, 11.2% gold and 18.5 % fixed income.\n\nAsset allocation alone explains 92% of returns in the portfolio with 8% coming from other factors like security selection and market timing. They believe using a combination of assets like equity gold and fixed income can help reduce volatility and maximise returns.\n\n Wealth managers believe as liquidity in ETFs increases and they get more popular, the number of offerings is likely to increase.\n\n\nRead More News onwealthInvestorsETFdiversificationportfolioSIPsmutual fund news(Catch all the latest news about  mutual funds, MF insights & analysis, best buys and investment trends on  ETMutualFunds.com)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

Illustration: Rahul Awasthi(This story originally appeared in  on Dec 03, 2021)Cryptocurrency exchanges are turning to targeted advertising and marketing campaigns to soothe the nerves of investors who are exiting their investments amid regulatory uncertainty over the virtual currencies.\n\nSome of the exchanges, including CoinDCX and CoinSwitch Kuber, have re-started advertising and marketing campaigns, albeit not as aggressively as earlier, industry insiders said. In most cases, the advertisements are aired on social media and other digital platforms.\n\nThe exchanges had suspended ads, after an advertising blitzkrieg in the past few months that were criticised for being puffery and misleading by many. The government, which has also raised concerns over lack of transparency in crypto ads, is working on legislation on the sector. Meanwhile, ET reported on Thursday that the Advertising Standards Council of India was in discussions with the government to include adequate disclosure of risk in the crypto ads to ensure that consumers don't mistake these products to be legal tender.\n\nAccording to a person part of the Blockchain and Crypto Assets Council, an industry advisory body, several exchanges wanted to restart advertising, especially targeting their existing investors. Some of them are looking to roll out advertisements across platforms in the coming week as they hope to get some clarity on the legality of crypto assets. \n\nCoinDCX and Coinswitch Kuber did not respond to ET's queries. \n\nA WazirX spokesperson said the exchange has not re-started any advertising but is focusing on \"investor education campaigns\". She said: \"Crypto is a new market in India and for our investors, we have ensured to keep all our communication channels open through all mediums and our social handles.\" \n\nIndian cryptocurrency exchanges are estimated to have collectively spent more than \u20b950 crore during the recently concluded ICC T20 World Cup, ET reported last month. \n\nThe ad blitz may have heightened government and regulatory concerns over virtual currencies and the commercials that promote them, said industry trackers. \n\n\"While the new advertisements are basic ones that inform about the exchange or there are marketing campaigns targeted at existing investors. The advertising spend for the sector is not as much as before,\" a person aware of the matter told ET. \"We will wait for the government to frame the guidelines and we will comply and act accordingly.\"\n\nThere has been a fall in new sign-ups on cryptocurrency exchanges, as prospective investors seem to be cautious till regulatory clarity emerges on the asset class. \n\nNew user sign-ups are a matrix used to value crypto companies.\n\n\nRead More News oncoindcxcoinswitch kubercryptoscryptocurrenciesblockchaincrypto ban(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

The Hyderabad-based brokerage had allegedly misappropriated client securities and used them to avail of loans from banks for other business arms of Karvy. SAT hears appeals in securities market cases.\n\nIn November last year, Sebi ordered impounding of Karvy's assets to provide compensation to defrauded investors. Based on this order, the National Stock Exchange (NSE) issued directions on December 8, 2020, saying that the bank accounts of Karvy must become assets of NSE's defaulter committee. \n\n\nPrivate lender Axis Bank challenged NSE's order in the SAT.\n\nAxis argued that Karvy owed it \u20b9165 crore and the money lying in the accounts of Karvy must be used to adjust these dues. At that time, the brokerage had deposits to the tune of \u20b98.27 crore in Axis Bank. The tribunal has ruled in favour of Axis.\n\n\"The impugned communication issued by NSE dated 8th December 2020 invoking bye-law 11 of its bye-laws is totally without jurisdiction and is quashed,\" said SAT in an 18-page order dated November 29.\n\nThe crux of Axis Bank's contention was that the private lender wasn't a market entity regulated by the National Stock Exchange (NSE) or the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) and the exchange had no powers to order the freezing of the bank accounts.\n\nThe development could impact the ability of exchanges and market regulator Sebi to recover dues of investors in cases of broker fraud, said legal experts.

In South and West India, there has been a rollback of Rs 10-20 per bag of the announced price hikes of Rs 20-50 per bag, said various brokerages. \n\nIn East India, too, weak demand led to a partial rollback of price hikes between 5 and 10 per bag. Analysts said that the near-term outlook is also not great for cement companies.\n\n\u201cDemand and pricing outlook for December is also bleak as generally it is a weak month for construction activities and year-end volume pressure from few companies will result in lower prices,\u201d said Mangesh Bhadang, analyst, Nirmal Bang. \u201cWe believe that current demand trends are worrisome, and we expect margin pressure for cement companies to increase in the December quarter on account of weak pricing and elevated cost pressures.\u201d\n\nVolumes transported through railways in November reported a sharp decline of 19% over October and 12% year-on-year. However, some believe the margins of cement companies may improve from the March 2022 quarter due to declining input costs.\n\n\n\nPick the best companies to investBECOME AN ETPRIME MEMBERRead More News oncementPrice hikeinput costsstockscompanies(What's moving Sensex and  Nifty  Track  latest market news,  stock tips and  expert advice on  ETMarkets.

In most cases, the advertisements are aired on social media and other digital platforms.\n\nThe exchanges had suspended ads, after an advertising blitzkrieg in the past few months that were criticised for being puffery and misleading by many. The government, which has also raised concerns over lack of transparency in crypto ads, is working on legislation on the sector. Meanwhile, ET reported on Thursday that the Advertising Standards Council of India was in discussions with the government to include adequate disclosure of risk in the crypto ads to ensure that consumers don\u2019t mistake these products to be legal tender.\n\nAccording to a person part of the Blockchain and Crypto Assets Council, an industry advisory body, several exchanges wanted to restart advertising, especially targeting their existing investors. Some of them are looking to roll out advertisements across platforms in the coming week as they hope to get some clarity on the legality of crypto assets.\n\nCoinDCX and Coinswitch Kuber did not respond to ET\u2019s queries. \n\nA WazirX spokesperson said the exchange has not re-started any advertising but is focusing on \u201cinvestor education campaigns\u201d.

This led the exchanges to stay away from advertisements till there was regulatory clarity.\n\n\u201cWhile the new advertisements are basic ones, that inform about the exchange or there are marketing campaigns targeted at existing investors. The advertising spend for the sector is not as much as before,\u201d a person aware of the matter told ET.\n\n\u201cWe will wait for the government to frame the guidelines and we will comply and act accordingly,\u201d this person added.\n\nThere has been a fall in new sign-ups on cryptocurrency exchanges, as prospective investors seem to be cautious till regulatory clarity emerges on the asset class.\n\nNew user sign-ups are a matrix used to value crypto companies.\n\nMany cryptocurrency exchanges are also waiting for the government to come out with guidelines around advertising.\n\nThe government is expected to do so in the next one month along with broad framework around cryptocurrencies.\n\nRead More News ontargeted adscryptocurrency exchangesmarketing campaignscryptocoindcxcoinswitch kuberCryptocurrencyStay on top of technology and startup news that matters.

The agreement will seek to address some of the issues raised by Invesco, especially those regarding Zee's founding family's future holdings in the merged company. But the onus will be on the investment firm to bless the deal, they said.\n\nInvesco, the single-largest shareholder in ZEE with a 17.88% stake, has taken the company to the courts over management control and other issues.\n\nZEE CEO Punit Goenka travelled to Los Angeles last week and met the senior leadership of Sony for the first time since the two agreed to join forces on September 22. While Goenka will continue to lead the merged company as its CEO, he will be the only ZEE executive to have a board seat. Five of the nine-member board will be top Sony executives. They will include Tony Vinciquerra, chairman and CEO, Sony SPE, who might be chairman. Ravi Ahuja, chairman, Global Television Studios and SPE corporate development, and Erik Moreno, executive vice president, corporate development and M&A, SPE, are also slated to become directors, along with two Japanese executives.\n\n\nKey Concern \n There will be three independent directors, of which one or two may get chosen from the current ZEE board that has been under fire from Invesco.\n\n\"It will be a board-run company and as agreed, Sony will have a lion's share of it,\" said an executive aware of the discussions.\n\nThe deal team working on behalf of the two companies is expected to address a key concern of shareholders: The mechanism by which ZEE's promoter family will be allowed to increase its shareholding from the current 3.99% to as much as 20%. The September announcement only said this will be in accordance with applicable laws, leaving room for interpretation.\n\n\n\nZEE is expected to clarify that such a process will not be dilutive to other shareholders. Any purchase will be from the open market at the prevailing market price and comply with India's 5% annual creeping acquisition threshold. \n\nIn an October 12 open letter, Invesco had reiterated its support for the ZEE-SPE non-binding term sheet but sought clarity on specifics, especially the non-compete fee and the equity clawback option.\n\n\"Will this change the majority control of Sony in the merged entity? Will it involve open market purchases, warrants, or some other financial instrument? If the latter, will said instruments/warrants to the promoter family be priced so as to advantage them at the cost of ordinary shareholders,\" it had asked in its open letter.\n\nSony will be the sole promoter of the merged entity with shareholders of Sony India owning 53% and those of ZEE holding the rest. Sony shareholders have also agreed to infuse about $1.58 billion.\n\nDeloitte is working with ZEE and KPMG is doing the due diligence for Sony. Boston Consulting Group is also involved along with KPMG Corporate Finance and Morgan Stanley, the deal advisors. \n\nZEE and Invesco declined to comment.\n\nSony didn't respond to queries. \n\n\nInvesco Stand\nThe largest investor in ZEE had issues with the no-compete and stake-enhancement parts of the non-binding deal document.\n\n\"There have been two principal sticking points - the 2% no-compete fee and the 4-20% clause,\" said an executive aware of the matter. \"While the former could have been structured better, the latter was non-negotiable. No minority shareholder would accept if this leads to their stake getting diluted. There are ways to avoid it like open-market purchases. The least they can do is to put this clause for a separate vote. If they club it with the overall merger problem, it will create issues.\"\n\nInvesco is hoping to meet the Sony management in the coming days along with legal counsel and seek clarity on the deal, said people with knowledge of the matter. If it's satisfied, analysts expect Invesco to soften its position. However, it's still not clear what Invesco's stand will be on the ongoing litigation.\n\nInvesco and ZEE have been at loggerheads over the removal of directors and the appointment of new ones besides the calling of an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) to discuss this. An executive close to Invesco said the onus is on ZEE to withdraw legal proceedings in the Bombay High Court. Still, if the Sony proposal is presented in a shareholder-friendly format, there's no reason not to be supportive.\n\n\"Invesco is here to maximise the value of ZEE and that is the fiduciary responsibility that they bear towards their investors as well,\" he said.\n\n\nRead More News onzee sony mergerinvescozeesonypuneet goenkatony vinciquerraravi ahujagtszee entertainment(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

The new guidelines will come into effect from January 1, 2022, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said in a circular. \n\n In order to facilitate investor awareness about several activities which an investor deals with such as opening of account, KYC and in-person verification, process for dematerialisation and complaint resolution, Sebi, in consultation with the market participants, has prepared an investor charter for stock brokers. \n\n This charter specified about rights of investors, various activities of stock brokers with timelines, dos and don'ts for investors and grievance redressal mechanism. \n\n In this regard, exchanges have been directed to advise stock brokers to bring the investor charter for stock brokers to the notice of their clients -- existing as well as new ones -- through disclosing the investor charter on their respective websites, making them available at prominent places in the office, provide a copy of the charter as a part of account opening kit to the clients, through e-mails or letters etc. \n\n Additionally, in a bid to bring about transparency in the investor grievance redressal mechanism, Sebi has asked brokers to disclose on their respective websites, the data on complaints received against them and redressal thereof. \n\n The data needs to be disclosed latest by 7th of succeeding month, Sebi said. \n\n In addition, the regulator has also prescribed a format for disclosing data of complaints on their websites. \n\n Under the disclosure, brokers will have to disclose about complaints received during the month, those carried forward from previous month, complaints pending for more than three months, complaints resolved and average time taken in resolution of a complaint, among others. \n\n Earlier, Sebi had asked depositories, Registrar and share transfer agents (RTAs) and merchant bankers to disclose on their websites, the investor charter for a bunch of categories. \n\n Besides, it had directed exchanges, depositories and clearing corporations to disclose on their websites, the data on complaints received against them and redressal thereof. \n\n This came after Sebi regulator came out with investor charter in November. This charter includes the rights and responsibilities of investors, and dos and don'ts of investing in the securities market. \n\n The charter is aimed at protecting the \"interests of investors by enabling them to understand the risks involved and invest in a fair, transparent, secure market, and to get services in a timely and efficient manner\". \n\n The rights include getting fair and equitable treatment, expecting redressal of investor grievances filed in SCORES in a time bound manner. \n\n Also, the market regulator created a separate investor charter for market infrastructure institutions-- stock exchanges, clearing corporations and depositories.\nPick the best companies to investBECOME AN ETPRIME MEMBERRead More News onSebiMarkets regulator SebiSecurities and Exchange Board of Indiastock brokersstock brokers disclosure(What's moving Sensex and  Nifty  Track  latest market news,  stock tips and  expert advice on  ETMarkets.

He said the Quad partnership has the capacity to address contemporary global challenges and mutual concerns while highlighting the importance of a rules-based international order. \n\nIn remarks at the 5th India-US Forum, he said the ability of the member states of the Quad to work together as democratic nations would also bolster respect for international law and ensure peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region. \n\n\"The Quad partnership is one of the ways in which we could address strategic competition and geopolitical challenges in the Indo-Pacific region,\" Shringla said. \n\n\"In recent times we have seen several countries articulating their vision and strategies for the Indo-Pacific. We welcome this trend, which is an indication of the growing significance of the Indo-Pacific and the importance of maintaining peace and stability in the region,\" he said. \n\nThe Quad, comprising India, the US, Japan and Australia, has emerged as a major platform focusing on ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific. \n\nUS President Joe Biden hosted the first in-person summit of Quad leaders in Washington in September. \n\nShringla said the way ahead will involve regular coordination among the Quad countries to implement the vision of leaders and crystallise the constructive spirit of the grouping. \n\nHe was speaking on the topic: 'Quad and Future of the Indo-Pacific'. \n\n\"Broadly, there are three kinds of initiatives that the Quad is handling - the first set has a practical implication and is aimed at the well-being of the people of the Indo-Pacific region,\" Shringla said. \n\nIn this context, the foreign secretary described as the \"prime example\" the Quad vaccine initiative that seeks to supply one billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine to countries in the region by the end of 2022. \n\n\"The second set of Quad initiatives will bring together the four countries to address contemporary issues such as cyber Security and 5G where Quad seeks to adopt and implement shared standards, principles and norms; and promote secure and trustworthy equipment and infrastructure,\" he said. \n\n\"Under the third category, Quad countries will collaborate amongst themselves through initiatives such as the Quad Fellowship programme,\" he added. \n\nShringla said the way ahead will involve regular coordination among the Quad countries to implement the vision of leaders and crystallise the constructive spirit of the grouping. \n\nHe said the COVID-19 vaccine initiative under the Quad framework, in particular, reflects its collective commitment to combat the pandemic. \n\n\"Timely delivery of vaccines will require all four countries leveraging their respective capacities,\" he said. \n\n\"The vaccine initiative will enhance global vaccination efforts and build resilient supply chains. It could also become the template for our work together in combating future pandemics, natural disasters, or building resilient supply chains,\" he said. \n\nIn his opening remarks, Shringla said the Quad has indeed come of age and is focussed on a positive agenda aimed at the well-being of the people of the Indo-Pacific region. \n\nHe said as vibrant and pluralistic democracies with shared values, India and the US share the vision of a peaceful and stable Indo-Pacific, where there is respect for international law, freedom of navigation, territorial integrity and sovereignty and peaceful settlement of disputes. \n\n\"This vision also brings together the Quad - which is committed to advancing the security and economic interests of all countries having legitimate and vital interests in the Indo-Pacific region,\" Shringla said.\nRead More News onQuad partnershipforeign secretaryharsh vardhan shringla(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

        "Article": "SynopsisThat seems unlikely: Gavi, the vaccine alliance that helps run COVAX, warned in internal documents that a substantial number of doses might only show up in late 2022 or even 2023 as wealthy countries drag out their donations while locking in contracts for new shots by the hundreds of millions.AgenciesAnd that need is only expected to increase - as many countries pursue boosters and tweaked vaccines that can tackle new variants.The global initiative to share coronavirus vaccines fairly already scaled back its pledge to the world's poor once. Now, to meet even that limited promise, COVAX would have to deliver more than a million doses every hour until the end of the year in some of the world's most challenging places.\n\n That seems unlikely: Gavi, the vaccine alliance that helps run COVAX, warned in internal documents that a substantial number of doses might only show up in late 2022 or even 2023 as wealthy countries drag out their donations while locking in contracts for new shots by the hundreds of millions.\n\n Even if the U.N.-backed initiative secured the doses and overcame the logistical hurdles, the developing world would still face a gaping need. COVAX's new promise is for 1.4 billion doses, but according to the documents, mid- and low-income countries need 4.65 billion to vaccinate 70% of their populations.\n\n And that need is only expected to increase - as many countries pursue boosters and tweaked vaccines that can tackle new variants.\n\n At this point more than half the world's population has received at least one shot, but only 6% of the population in the poorest countries have. Meanwhile, richer countries are pushing ahead with buying up third and fourth doses for their citizens.\n\n COVAX was formed soon after COVID-19 became a pandemic, intended to guarantee that low- and middle-income countries would quickly get vaccine doses - without having to muscle their way into competitive markets with nations that could outbid them or be at the mercy of unreliable donations. Getting vaccines to every corner of the globe is especially important because experts say that until protection is broadly spread across the world, everyone remains at risk.\n\n But COVAX lacked cash during the crucial months that the United States, countries in Europe and other wealthy nations locked in contracts. Its first delivery came Feb. 24 - to Ghana - more than two months after injections started in Britain and the United States. \n\n Poor countries fell further behind by the day, and COVAX was dealt a new blow in March when the Serum Institute of India, which was supposed to be its main supplier, cut off exports to boost domestic vaccine supplies amid a massive surge in coronavirus cases. Those exports are only now resuming.\n\n In September, COVAX abandoned its initial goal to deliver 2 billion doses by the end of 2021, reducing it to 1.4 billion. \n\n Gavi and the World Health Organization have trumpeted each donation pledge in bold headlines in news releases, while quietly burying the much smaller numbers of donated doses that are actually delivered. \n\n \"We have been vocal in calling out high income countries for hoarding vaccines and manufacturers for failing to prioritize COVAX, which represents a failure of multilateralism, not of COVAX, and I'm proud that COVAX has been able to make such a transformative impact in countries that otherwise would have been left out in the cold completely,\" said Aurelia Nguyen, its managing director.\n\n But Gavi and WHO have both shied away from criticizing their biggest donor countries by name, even when they began vaccinating children or offering boosters to healthy adults - despite WHO's plea to countries to prioritize the world's poor over boosters and shots for kids at home. WHO's position on boosters could change depending on what's learned about omicron.\n\n Despite the setbacks, in private briefings to partners ahead of a board meeting that ends Thursday, Gavi has consistently maintained that an increased vaccine supply in late 2021 would salvage their goals.\n\n The hope was rich countries would wrap up their immunization campaigns in late 2021, and send more doses to the rest of the world. \n\n That hasn't happened. \n\n The push for booster shots in many wealthier countries presented the first obstacle - though it's not clear they make it impossible to keep promises. Rich countries pledged to donate 1.2 billion doses by mid-2022, and data from analytics company Airfinity from mid-October showed that those donations could go out this year and there would still be enough for boosters at home.\n\n Now, manufacturers are looking at creating second-generation vaccines to tackle variants. Airfinity said that would take until late next year at best for a global rollout and would mean taking current vaccine production offline. \n\n Not only that, but emerging preferences for certain shots - with better safety and efficacy profiles or easier transport requirements - undermined COVAX's hope to use a wide pool of WHO-authorized vaccines, including those made in China, Russia and India.\n\n As COVAX transitions from emergency mechanism into longer-term effort, some public health officials want to abandon the model altogether. \n\n \"There hasn't been any admission of how badly they miscalculated things,\" said Kate Elder, senior vaccines policy adviser at Doctors Without Borders. \n\n She explained that a significant proportion of COVAX doses are now based on donations, rather than the deals with pharmaceuticals the effort was banking on last year. That's because rich countries including Britain, Canada, Germany and others signed early deals with drugmakers that reserved the vast majority of the limited COVID-19 vaccine supply, cutting out COVAX. Meanwhile, their promised donations are only trickling in.\n\n Sajid Javid, Britain's health minister, was asked about the discrepancy between rich and poor nations when it comes to vaccines and booster shots. He told Parliament on Monday that he and his counterparts among the G-7 wealthy nations understood the need to share with poor nations and had \"all agreed about the importance of this and about redoubling efforts.\"\n\n Four days later, the U.K. announced it had sealed deals into 2023 to offer Britons fourth doses. \n\n \"I don't know if there's a way to make governments not hoard vaccines, so maybe we need a way to force them to donate a certain percentage instead,\" Elder said.\n\n Although COVAX has now revised some of its initial practices, little has been changed about the effort's fundamental structure.\n\n But Dr. Madhukar Pai, of McGill University's School of Population and Public Health, said the blame primarily rests with governments of wealthy countries that are ignoring basic public health tenets.\n\n \"It's almost as if they've decided their main strategy for pandemic response is to purely protect themselves with more and more doses and to close borders to anyone who might bring the virus in. This is primitive thinking,\" Pai said. \"The amount of money that would be required to vaccinate the whole world, and if you compare it with the carnage, the lives lost, the economic loss. ... It's the deal of the century.\"\n\n In a statement last week, Gavi applauded Switzerland's decision to cede its place to COVAX in the queue to obtain Moderna vaccines. \n\n That would mean COVAX will get 1 million doses later this year - putting it nearly an hour closer to its goal.\n\nRead More News onCOVAXcoronavirus vaccinesWorld Health Organization(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

In a joint statement the group called on Lukashenko's government to immediately and completely halt its orchestrating of irregular migration across its borders with the EU.\n\n \"Those, in Belarus or in third countries, who facilitate illegal crossing of the EU's external borders should know this comes at a substantial cost,\" the statement said.\n\n The action came as East-West tensions have risen over the refugee crisis on the borders between Belarus, a Russian ally, and Poland and Lithuania.\n\n The Belarusian Foreign Ministry said it would retaliate against the EU sanctions. In a statement, it said: \"The goal of this policy is to economically strangle Belarus, to complicate and worsen the life of Belarusians.\"\n\n \"As a response, as we have previously said, we will take harsh, asymmetrical but adequate measures.\"\n\n It did not immediately comment on the action from the United States, Canada or the United Kingdom.\n\n The U.S. Treasury Department issued a directive restricting Americans from transacting in, provision of and other dealings in new Belarusian sovereign debt with a maturity greater than 90 days issued on or after Thursday by the country's finance ministry or Development Bank.\n\n\nPOTASH SECTOR\nWashington also imposed sanctions on Belarus's state-owned tourism company, Republican Unitary Enterprise Tsentrkurort, and seven Belarusian government officials over the migrant crisis.\n\n EU countries have accused Belarus of creating a migrant standoff on the bloc's eastern borders by encouraging thousands from the Middle East and Africa to try to cross into Poland and Lithuania, in revenge for Western sanctions on Minsk. \n\n Lukashenko denies doing so and pins the blame for the crisis on the EU.\n\n Rights groups say at least 13 people have died as migrants have camped in freezing conditions at the border.\n\n Entities related to the potash sector were also blacklisted on Thursday. Britain targeted one of the world's largest potash fertiliser producers, Belaruskali, while Washington imposed sanctions on several entities in an effort to limit the financial benefits Lukashenko's government derives from potash exports.\n\n Washington had already blacklisted the state-run Belaruskali in August, but added its exporting arm, the Belarus Potash Company, and another potash producer, Slavkali. Shares of global potash producers rose on Thursday following the announcement.\n\n The U.S. Treasury issued a general licence, authorizing activities necessary for the wind-down of transactions involving the Belarusian Potash Company or its subsidiary, Agrorozkvit LLC, until April 1.\n\n Belarus Potash Company did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\n\nDEFENSE FIRMS\nWashington also blacklisted state-owned cargo carrier Transaviaexport Airlines, which it accused of shipping thousands of tons of ammunition and weapons to foreign conflict zones such as Libya, and two of its aircraft, as well as five entities that produce or export defense materials.\n\n The defense firms listed included the makers of riot control barriers and armored vehicles that were deployed against demonstrators protesting the August 2020 election, a surveillance system maker and the state weapons exporter that provides cash for the government.\n\n Brian O'Toole, a former Treasury official now with the Atlantic Council, said Thursday's move helped the United States catch up with previous European Union action while also leaving \"significant\" room for escalation, giving Washington leverage to continue to pressure Minsk.\n\n \"This is exactly what you want to see out of the U.S. It's a big action, it will have lots of impact, and there's still lots of head room,\" he said.\n\n\n( Originally published on Dec 02, 2021 )Read More News onUnited Statesbelarusian sovereign debtbelarus sanctionseuropean unioncanadabritain(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

A member of the Maharashtra government's COVID-19 task force on Thursday said that vigilance, genome sequencing, improving border surveillance and vaccination are some of the things that are necessary to tackle the new Omicron variant of coronavirus. The task force member, Dr Vasant Nagvekar, who is a consultant on infectious diseases at a city-based hospital, said in a statement that although there was no need to panic, the Omicron variant is definitely a cause of concern. \n\n\"What we need is vigilance.

But, in this case, a bigger matter is at stake - Tiger 3.Policymakers are following one news item carefully: whether Salman Khan and his family are not invited to the wedding of Katrina Kaif and Vicky 'Not Just Donor' Kaushal scheduled next week. There is no reason why one should not believe Khan's sister, Arpita, who stated that the Khans have not received an invitation. So, what should policymakers - who have always maintained in these post-non-aligned movement times that one should not cut off diplomatic ties with 'special friend status' entities-turned-plain entities - do now? Make backroom efforts to reach out to the Kaushal family, requesting them to womanfully send off a last-minute invitation to - or, even better, meet - the Khan matriarch, Helen, and ask for her (and no one else's) blessings?\n\nA wedding invite list is, of course, the prerogative of the families of the bride and groom.

By virtue of the assembly elections results in that state, she is also within reason to think that she is a prime candidate for an Opposition to coalesce around. To be fair to her, she has not spoken about a Congress-mukt alliance.

By dint of its spreadsheet, Congress' presence makes it a valuable ingredient in a national anti-BJP mix. Its leadership in such an entity is, however, no longer a given. It is this fact that Banerjee, after meeting Sharad Pawar this week, has underlined.\n\nThe United Progressive Alliance - branded as a Congress-led formulation - may, indeed, be past its use-by date.

        "Article": "SynopsisWe are also now now researching whether in certain industries, corporate character is starting to matter more than capability \u2014 historically, customers cared most about the actual product capability but now, in advisory services, investment banking and legal services, corporate character is becoming increasingly important.Agencies Purpose should be a fundamental articulation of why an organisation exists \u2014 that should then become the base framework on which you make investment decisions and choose how to deploy your financial, human and natural capital.Rupert Younger is the founder and director of Oxford University\u2019s Centre for Corporate Reputation and Chair of the Enacting Purpose Initiative (EPI). Speaking to Srijana Mitra Das, he discusses why ideas of corporate character will become increasingly important to consumers, suppliers, employees and regulators:\n\n\nQ. What is the core of your research?\nA. I lead research at Oxford which focuses on \u2018social evaluators\u2019 \u2014 this means reputation, trust, status and legitimacy. All four have significant value to individuals, companies, governments and institutions. We study how these assets are created, sustained, destroyed and rebuilt.\n\n\nQ. Why do you say capability and character are key to how companies are perceived?\nA. Capability and character are the two critical dimensions through which we evaluate entities \u2014 they are absolutely fundamental diagnostic frames. When we think about what organisations do, how competent they are, their record of making good products or delivering good services, etc., that is a capability lens. Our second lens encompasses impression s of or g a n i s at ion a l character \u2014 this includes assumptions about a company as a customer, supplier, employee, regulator or any stakeholder group. Corporate character is very important when it comes to counterparties like investors and suppliers while capability is the lead indicator when it comes to customers.\n\nWe are also now now researching whether in certain industries, corporate character is starting to matter more than capability \u2014 historically, customers cared most about the actual product capability but now, in advisory services, investment banking and legal services, corporate character is becoming increasingly important.\n\nWe see the same in very competitive industries where there is product ubiquity \u2014 corporate character is becoming an increasingly important determinant of social evaluators here.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ. With businesses making commitments to ESG and net zero, will corporate reputations grow more prominent in the minds of consumers, regulators, etc.?\nA. ESG strategies are all about the role of business in society which has become a dominant theme. We will increasingly see stakeholders asking what they can expect socially from a corporation, whether it takes care of the environment, whether it assumes responsibility for its products and services, etc. These answers are no longer just nice to have \u2014 they are must-haves.\n\nA fundamental change is taking place, which ties into the larger debate over the responsibility and future of capitalism. This discussion has returned after the Milton Friedman debate because of ESG issues and how investors are pressuring companies to think much more carefully about their ESG actions. Big tectonic forces are underpinning these changes in norms and expectations around business.\n\n\nQ. Can you share key insights about building \u2018reputational capital\u2019 as discussed in your book \u2018The Reputation Game\u2019?A. I\u2019ve identified three different mechanisms in the book, all of which are in a company\u2019s control. Reputation isn\u2019t in a company\u2019s direct control unlike its finance or marketing strategy. It is in the hands of others. You can\u2019t control your reputation but you can influence it.\n\nI set out these influence strategies in three ways. The first is your behavioural choices \u2014 this includes ESG, etc., which send signals that set expectations around your corporate character. The second is your network strategies \u2014 this goes back to the adage that you\u2019re known by the company you keep. Your choices of who you associate with, from partners to investors and employees, a re important determinants of what people expect from you. The third is your narrative strategies \u2014 t hi s i s fundamental because story-telling unites people most productively.\n\nUnilever has done very well with all these mechanisms. It thought strategically about the core questions and invested in purpose-led business, making its authenticity clear to consumers, investors and regulators.\n\nIt built these choices into its strategy and took responsible positions in its supply chains, including with partners like Nestl\u00e9, L\u2019Oreal, etc. Further, its strategic story-telling has been absolutely on point.\n\n\nQ. What is \u2018purpose governance\u2019 and why is this important?\nA. Purpose governance is about how you govern the articulation and enactment of purpose within your organisation. At the Enacting Purpose Initiative, we argue that purpose must be governed as a strategic north star, as opposed to a marketing tool. Purpose should be a fundamental articulation of why an organisation exists \u2014 that should then become the base framework on which you make investment decisions and choose how to deploy your financial, human and natural capital.\n\nPurpose should sit ahead of strategic choices rather than following these \u2014 those who are poor of purpose governance retrofit or wrap narratives around their predetermined decisions but this leads to charges of inauthenticity. On the other hand, we\u2019re seeing companies like Black & Decker and Premium Credit doing purpose governance very well.\n\nRead More News onreputationalcapitalrupert youngESG Choicescapability(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"

The RP set deadline of 22 December for firm bidsAgenciesRepresentative ImageThe resolution professional of KSK Mahanadi Power Ltd has received fresh expressions of interest from a Vedanta entity, Adani Power, Naveen Jindal\u2019s Jindal Power, Dharampal Jindal\u2019s Jindal Polymer, Power Finance Corporation and iLabs India Special Situation Fund, said people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nThese apart, Medha Servo Drives, Riddhi Siddhi Gluco Biol, Medha Engineering, Alchemist Asset Reconstruction Company in partnership with Cygnet Projects, Invest ARC and Prudent ARC promoter RKG Fund II also submitted expressions of interest, for which the deadline was last Monday, the people said.\n\nThe resolution professional, Sumit Binani, did not respond to a request for comment till press time Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, State Bank of India on Thursday set a reserve of Rs 1,423 crore for its principal overdue of Rs 4,101 crore from KSK Mahanadi Power, according to a notice issued by the bank on its website. The bank has invited expressions of interest by December 6 for an all-cash auction. The last day for firm bids is December 30, according to the notice.\n\nThis will be the largest all-cash deal in the distressed asset space till date, said one bank official. This will help the bank post bumper profits since not only Rs 1,423 crore will be added to the earnings, but also because there will be a reversal of provisions it had made, the same banker said.\n\nIncluding interest overdue, the bank has verified financial claims of Rs 5,060 crore, according to the claims list published by the company. The reserve price will equate to 28 paise on a rupee on SBI's financial claims of Rs 5,060 crore.\n\n\u201cThe SBI trade could set that benchmark since the secondary market trades in the distressed asset space are often an indicator of the recovery that lenders would make,\u201d pointed out one of the people cited above.\n\nVarde Partners-backed Aditya Birla Asset Reconstruction Company has 20% of KSK Mahanadi debt after it acquired loans from Axis Bank, Punjab National Bank and Bank of Baroda over the last 18 months. If Aditya Birla ARC wins SBI\u2019s outstanding loans, it would have a little over 37% of the company\u2019s debt which would be adequate to block any resolution proposed by the committee of creditors. As per the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India, a resolution can be passed only if 66% of creditors by value vote in favour of it.\n\nBinani, the PwC-backed resolution professional, has invited firm bids by December 22, according to a notice issued on the company\u2019s website. Recently, the Hyderabad National Company Law Tribunal directed the RP to restart the process, after Riddhi Siddhi Gluco Biols claimed that it was not given a fair chance to participate as an applicant even as the committee of creditors made an exception for a Naveen Jindal group company, according to a court order.\n\nThe company was admitted for the corporate resolution process two years ago. The RP has accepted Rs 29,216 crore financial creditors claim as of October 19 this year, according to the company\u2019s website\n\n\nRead More News onedanta entityadanijindal powerpfciLabsKSK Mahanadi Power Ltd(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.ETPrime stories of the dayAviationPrivatisation of airports: here\u2019s why patience will be the most prudent strategy for AAI15 mins readInvestigationHow Omicron infected a world of half-baked facts, corporate greed, and parochial politics13 mins readUnder the lensMind your language: how fake news is clean-bowling Big Tech and what needs to be done7 mins readSubscribe to ETPrime"
