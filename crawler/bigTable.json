Friday, Dec. 3 report from the Labor Department also showed that the nation's unemployment rate tumbled from 4.6% to 4.2% evidence that many more people reported that they had a job. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski)\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 America's unemployment rate tumbled last month to its lowest point since the pandemic struck, even as employers appeared to slow their hiring \u2014 a mixed picture that pointed to a resilient economy that's putting more people to work. \nThe government reported Friday that businesses and other employers added just 210,000 jobs in November, the weakest monthly gain in nearly a year and less than half of October's increase of 546,000. \nBut other data from the Labor Department's report painted a brighter picture. The unemployment rate plummeted from 4.6% to 4.2% as a substantial 1.1 million Americans said they found jobs last month. \nThe U.S. economy still remains under threat from a spike in inflation, shortages of labor and supplies and the potential impact of the omicron variant of the coronavirus. But for now, Americans are spending freely, and the economy is forecast to expand at a 7% annual rate in the final three months of the year, a sharp rebound from the 2.1% pace in the previous quarter, when the delta variant hobbled growth.\nEmployers in some industries, such as restaurants, bars, and hotels, pulled back on hiring in November. By contrast, job growth remained solid in areas like transportation and warehousing, which are benefiting from the growth of online commerce.\nThe fall in the unemployment rate was particularly encouraging because it coincided with an influx of a half-million job-seekers into the labor force, most of whom quickly found work. Normally, many such people would take time to find jobs and would be counted as unemployed until they did. The influx of new job-seekers, if it continues, would help reduce the labor shortages that have bedeviled many employers since the economy began to recover from the pandemic. \n\u201cThat\u2019s good news for job seekers and workers, and for businesses too,\" said Julia Pollak, chief economist at online jobs site ZipRecruiter. \u201cIt looks like the supply constraints are easing a bit with the unemployment rate low and wage growth high\u201d \u2014 two factors that often encourage people to search for work. \nNovember's report reflects a divergence in two surveys that the government conducts each month. The unemployment rate is calculated from a survey of households. For last month, this survey found that 1.1 million more people reported that they were employed. A separate survey of employers, called the payroll survey, reported just 210,000 added jobs. \nThough the results of the two surveys typically match up over the long run, they can differ sharply in any one month. For November, economists noted that the big employment gain in the household survey brought that figure in line with the larger increases in the payroll survey during previous months. \nThe hiring gains in the payroll survey have also been revised up substantially in recent months, and some economists suggested that this will likely happen again in coming months. \n\u201cMy sense is the household estimate is closer to the truth around what is happening in the jobs market and ... should anticipate a significant upward revision to the November data next month,\u201d said Joseph Brusuelas, an economist at RSM, a tax and advisory firm. \nThe household survey also captures self-employed and gig workers, whose ranks have grown steadily since the pandemic struck, unlike the payroll survey. Some economists attribute part of the nation's labor shortage to an increase in people who have recently gone to work for themselves. \nAmong them is Daniel Nolan of Raleigh, North Carolina. Like millions of other Americans, Nolan, 36, had his life and work upended by COVID-19. His 9-year old son was in virtual school at the outset of the pandemic. And his father-in-law, ill with cancer, moved in with his family, prompting Nolan to leave his job as a software engineer at a private equity firm. \nNolan expected this period to last only a few months. But when he began looking for work again, the job offers he got weren't what he was looking for. So in August, he decided to strike out on his own.\nSo far, Nolan said, he's earning roughly the same income that he did before. He plans to keep consulting for at least two more years \u2014 and may never return to a corporate job. \n\u201cI\u2019m able to make at least as much as I was making at my previous job and still have the flexibility of being a consultant,\u201d he said.\nFriday's report showed that the number of unemployed Americans sank in November to 6.9 million, compared with the pre-pandemic number of 5.7 million. And average wages, which have been rising as employers try to attract or keep workers, increased a strong 4.8% from a year ago. \nFor months, employers have been struggling with worker shortages because many people who lost jobs in the pandemic have not, for various reasons, returned to the workforce. But last month, nearly 600,000 people came off the sidelines to look for jobs and were generally hired quickly. The government classifies people as unemployed only if they\u2019re actively seeking work.\nAs a result, the proportion of Americans who are in the workforce rose from 61.6% to 61.8%, the first significant increase since April. If that much-anticipated development continues, it could point to stronger job growth ahead.\nEven as the jobless rate has steadily declined this year, the proportion of Americans who are working or searching for jobs has barely budged, at least until this month. A shortage of job-seekers tends to limit hiring and force companies to pay more to attract and keep employees. Higher pay can help sustain spending and growth. But it can also feed inflation if businesses raise prices to offset their higher labor costs, which they often do. \nWhether or not the increase in job-seekers continues is a critical question for the Federal Reserve. If the proportion of people in the workforce doesn\u2019t rise much, it would suggest that the Fed is nearing its goal of maximum employment.\nWith inflation at a three-decade high and far above the Fed\u2019s 2% annual target, reaching its employment mandate would heighten pressure on Chair Jerome Powell to raise interest rates sooner rather than later. Doing so would make loans more expensive for many individuals and businesses.\nThe government's survey of businesses suggested that some employers were more cautious about hiring last month. Restaurants, bars and hotels added just 23,000 jobs, down from 170,000 in October. That could reflect the effects of an uptick in COVID-19 cases last month and a reduction in outdoor dining. \nRetailers cut 20,000 jobs, a sign that holiday hiring hasn't been as strong as in previous years. But transportation and warehousing firms added 50,000 positions, which indicates that online retailers and shippers anticipate healthy online shopping. \nJeff Crivello, CEO of BBQ Holdings, which owns about 300 restaurants, said that for him, hiring has become a little easier in recent months. None of his restaurants are now closing early because of staff shortages. But it's still a struggle. The company hired more than 300 people in November yet still has about 500 open jobs. \n\u201cThe pandemic,\" Crivello said, \u201cushered in a seismic shift in consumer behavior and demand and the desires of the workforce.\u201d\nHis company has raised average hourly pay 15% since the pandemic struck but is competing with the new opportunities that many restaurant workers have, including higher-paying jobs at warehouses or in trucking. Many younger workers, Crivello said, are finding jobs in the cannabis industry or in gaming or even making money building followings on social media.\nThe jobs outlook for the coming months has become hazier with the emergence of the omicron variant. Little is definitively known about omicron, and widespread business shutdowns are considered unlikely. Still, omicron could discourage some Americans from traveling, shopping and eating out in the coming months and potentially slow the economy.\n___\nAP Business Writer Mae Anderson in New York contributed to this report. 7 Tech Stocks That Are Heating Up as Anti-Trust Talk Cools DownFor the better part of the last year, Congress has had \u201cbig tech\u201d in its crosshairs. But the reasons why largely depend on what side of the aisle a particular individual was on.\n\nOn the one hand, there are politicians who are concerned about the role that technology companies play in restricting the free flow of information. On the other hand, there are politicians that are concerned about these companies' stranglehold on competitors and innovation.\n\nBut big tech scored an important, albeit not final, victory in late June. At that time, a U.S. judge dismissed two separate complaints against Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). The question in front of the judge was whether Facebook held a monopoly on social media. Due to a surge in the company\u2019s stock price after the ruling, Facebook became a member of the exclusive $1 trillion market cap club.\nWhile big tech companies will remain under the Congressional microscope, there\u2019s no denying that investors are looking at the ruling as a signal to rotate back into tech stocks. And that\u2019s the focus of this presentation. What tech stocks should you be buying as anti-trust pressure eases?\n\nIt would be easy to start and end the list with the FAANG stocks. After all, the motto \u201cKeep it Simple Stupid\u201d comes to mind. There are simply those companies that offer products that are changing our lives now and will continue to do so in the future. And furthermore, customers will continue to pay for their products.\n\nAnd I do have a couple of these stocks on my list. But the bulk of the stocks on this list are less expensive alternatives to at least one of the FAANG stocks. It doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re superior companies, but a rising tide tends to lift all boats. And that means these companies have a large upside and you can purchase the stocks for a lot less.

(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert)\nRESERVE, La. (AP) \u2014 Michael Coleman's house is the last one standing on his tiny street, squeezed between a sprawling oil refinery whose sounds and smells keep him up at night and a massive grain elevator that covers his pickup in dust and, he says, exacerbates his breathing problems.\nColeman, 65, points to the billowing smokestacks just outside his backyard. \u201cOh, when the plants came in, they built right on top of us,\" he said. \u201cWe was surrounded by sugarcane, and now we\u2019re surrounded by (industrial) plants.\u201d\nThe oil company offered Coleman a buyout, but he rejected it. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for a fair shake,\" he said in an interview on the front steps of the home he has lived in for more than 50 years. In the meantime, he copes with high blood pressure, thyroid problems and other health issues that he attributes to decades of pollution from his industrial neighbors, a Marathon Petroleum refinery and a Cargill grain depot.\nSt. John the Baptist Parish, where Coleman lives, is part of an 85-mile (137-kilometer) stretch from New Orleans to Baton Rouge officially known as the Mississippi River Chemical Corridor, but more commonly called Cancer Alley. The region contains several hotspots where cancer risks are far above levels deemed acceptable by the Environmental Protection Agency.\nEPA Administrator Michael Regan visited Coleman and other area residents on a five-day \u201cJourney to Justice\u201d tour that highlighted low-income, mostly minority communities adversely affected by decades of industrial pollution. \nA Toxics Release Inventory prepared by EPA shows that minority groups make up 56% of those living near toxic sites such as refineries, landfills and chemical plants. Negative effects include chronic health problems such as asthma, diabetes and hypertension. \n\u201cI\u2019m able to put faces and names with this term that we call environmental justice,\" Regan said at a news conference outside Coleman\u2019s ramshackle home, where a blue tarp covers roof damage from Hurricane Ida.\n\u201cThis is what we are talking about when we talk about \u2018fence-line communities\u2019 \u2014 those communities who have been disproportionately impacted by pollution and are having to live in these conditions,\" Regan said, gesturing to the grain elevator in front of him and refinery behind. A railroad track runs just outside the property with the Mississippi River a few blocks down.\nIn nearby St. James, Regan met with Brenda Bryant, whose neighborhood is surrounded by oil storage tanks and a hulking refinery.\n\u201cWe are actually sandwiched in. And I\u2019m the meat,\" Bryant told Regan, who assured her that she and others he met with \u201cwill have a seat at the table\" as officials develop solutions for long-ignored communities.\nA former environmental regulator in his native North Carolina, Regan has made environmental justice a top priority since taking over as EPA head in March. As the first Black man to lead the agency, the issue \"is really personal for me, as well as professional,'' Regan said in an interview.\n\u201cAs I look at many of the folks in these communities, they look just like me. They look just like my son, and it\u2019s really tough to see them question the quality of their drinking water,'' he said.\nHistorically marginalized communities like St. John and St. James, along with cities such as New Orleans, Jackson, Mississippi, and Houston will benefit from the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law signed by President Joe Biden, Regan said. The law includes $55 billion for water and wastewater infrastructure, while a sweeping climate and social policy bill pending in the Senate would pump more than twice that amount into EPA programs to clean up the environment and address water and environmental justice issues.\nWhile legislation can help, Regan acknowledged that decades of neglect and widespread health problems among mostly Black and Brown communities won\u2019t be solved overnight. Loose permitting requirements for industrial sites, along with exclusionary zoning laws and housing practices, have long funneled racial and ethnic minorities into areas near toxic pollutants at rates far higher than the overall population.\nAt a congressional hearing in October, oil company executives sidestepped questions about whether refineries and other facilities are more likely to be located in low-income and minority communities.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got oil refineries along the U.S. Gulf Coast, and we\u2019re very proud to be community members there,\" Shell Oil President Gretchen Watkins told Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo.\n\u201cYour profit-driven choices threaten my life, the lives of my family, my neighbors, and our communities every single day,\" Bush responded.\nIn Louisiana, a recent inspector general\u2019s report faulted EPA for failing to protect St. John, St. James and other parishes from chloroprene and ethylene oxide, toxic chemicals used in industrial processes.\n\u201cIf EPA, the federal government, the state government, the local governments had been doing things correctly, we wouldn\u2019t be here,\u2033 Regan said in St. John. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously a problem with the way we have implemented our laws. And quite frankly, there may be a problem with existing law.\"\nEnvironmental injustice is not limited to the South, and Regan has also visited hard-hit areas in cities such as Chicago, Detroit and Los Angeles, as well as brownfields and tribal areas in North Dakota.\n\u201cFor the first time we\u2019re not questioning whether or not these environmental injustices exist,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are actually acknowledging that they do. We need to give these individuals a voice and talk about what we\u2019re going to do to solve these problems moving forward.''\nMore immediately, Regan promised that EPA will use its enforcement power to ensure a former DuPont petrochemical plant near Coleman\u2019s home complies with federal regulations on emissions of chloroprene and other harmful chemicals. The facility is now owned by Japanese conglomerate Denka.\n\u201cWe have enforcement authority that we\u2019re taking a very close look at to bring the facility in compliance \u2014 not just this facility, but all the facilities across the country who have been non-compliant, who have not honored the agreements that we have to be good neighbors and protect these communities,\" he told residents in St. John. \n\u201cThe message here to these communities is, we have to do better and we will do better,\" Regan said.\nSCHOOL WITHOUT WATER\nRegan's first stop on the tour was at Wilkins Elementary School in Jackson, Mississippi, where students are forced to use portable restrooms outside the building because low water pressure from the city\u2019s crumbling infrastructure makes school toilets virtually unusable.\nThe pressure was so low on the day Regan visited that the school was closed. The next day, more than a dozen Jackson schools were closed because of a lack of water.\nAs the father of an 8-year-old, \u201cmy heart was broken today,\" Regan told The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating to see the disruptions they face.\"\nFourth-graders brought to the school to meet with Regan spoke of their own frustrations. Kingston Lewis, 9, said he doesn\u2019t like going outside to use the restroom in a mobile trailer.\n\u201cIt takes a lot of learning time throughout our day, and it has an unpleasant scent sometimes when you go outside,\" he told Regan.\nPrincipal Cheryl Brown called the school\u2019s dependence on portable toilets \u201cdegrading\u201d and \u201cinhumane on all levels.\" Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba called the water outages \u201da cycle of humiliation within our community\u201d and an example of \u201cwhat it looks like for our children when we fail to provide.\"\nLumumba said in an interview that his impoverished city needs about $2 billion to fix its water infrastructure, but expects to receive far less from the infrastructure law and other federal spending. The majority Black city often \u201cfails to get its equitable share of resources that funnel through the state\u201d and its Republican governor and GOP-controlled legislature, he said.\nAMERICAN DREAM OR \u2018NIGHTMARE\u2019?\nRegan also visited Gordon Plaza, a New Orleans neighborhood built on the site of a former toxic landfill, and the creosote-contaminated Kashmere Gardens neighborhood in Houston. Gordon Plaza was designated as a Superfund site in the 1990s, but dozens of mostly Black families still live there, waiting for a buyout, and many feel forgotten.\nA 2019 report by Louisiana State University found that the city\u2019s Desire section, which includes Gordon Plaza, had the second-highest cancer rate in the state.\nDuring a walking tour, neighborhood residents gave Regan a T-shirt as they urged him to remember their community\u2019s name. They cheered when he said the words \u201cGordon Plaza\u201d had reached the White House. \u201cYou have my commitment that the EPA will partner with you all to solve this problem,\u201d he said.\nNew Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell has pledged to help Gordon Plaza residents, but her budget proposal did not include money to help families move to new homes. The New Orleans City Council approved $2 million to assess the site, and officials said they hope to use money from the infrastructure law to relocate families and build a solar farm there.\nResidents have heard promises before.\n\u201cYou\u2019re trying to live out the American Dream \u2014 which turns out to be a nightmare \u2014 and you can\u2019t get justice, you know,\u201d said resident Earl Smothers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s environmental racism,\u2033 resident Lydwina Hurst told Regan. Still, Hurst said she appreciated Regan\u2019s visit and is hopeful residents will finally get the help they need.\nBeverly Wright, executive director of the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice, a New Orleans-based group that hosted Regan at several Louisiana sites, said the problems Regan witnessed are \u201cgenerational battles\" with no easy solution.\nStill, she\u2019s optimistic that \u201cthe wheels are aligning\u201d to finally address problems that have festered locally for decades.\n\u201cI think putting a face and a name on these problems makes it personal,\" Wright said. \u201cWhen you can taste the chemicals in your mouth and smell the toxins downwind, it\u2019s a lot more difficult to ignore.\"Should you invest $1,000 in DuPont de Nemours right now?Before you consider DuPont de Nemours, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

But that has been placed on hold by federal judges (AP Photo/Jeenah Moon, File)\nMillions of health care workers across the U.S. were supposed to have their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine by this coming Monday under a mandate issued by President Joe Biden's administration. Thanks to legal challenges, they won't have to worry about it, at least for now.\nSame goes for a Jan. 4 deadline set by the administration for businesses with at least 100 employees to ensure their workers are vaccinated or tested weekly for the virus.\nJudges responding to lawsuits brought by Republican-led states, businesses and other opponents have blocked some of Biden's most sweeping initiatives intended to drive up vaccination rates. Numerous other legal challenges are pending, contesting the Democratic president's vaccine requirements for federal employees and contractors and members of the military, as well as mask requirements for people using public transportation. \n\nMore than four-fifths of adults nationwide already have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. But Biden contends his various workforce vaccine mandates are an important step in curtailing the virus, which has killed more than 780,000 people in the U.S. \nOpponents have taken a three-tiered approach to challenging Biden's requirements. In lawsuits, they contend the vaccine mandates were imposed without proper public comment, were not authorized by Congress and infringe on states' rights to regulate public health matters.\n\u201cThe reasoning across the cases is basically the same, which is that these statutes don\u2019t give the president or the agency in question the authority to issue the mandates,\" said Gregory Magarian, a constitutional law professor at Washington University in St. Louis.\nThe Biden administration contends its rule-making authority is firm and supersedes any state policies prohibiting vaccine requirements. Recent experience shows that such mandates generally prompt people to get vaccinated. By the time a Biden requirement for federal workers to be vaccinated took effect last month, 92% had received at least their first dose of the shot.\nFollowing is a rundown of some of Biden's most sweeping vaccine requirements and the status of the legal fights over them.\nLARGE BUSINESS MANDATE\nWhat it would do: Under a rule published by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration on Nov. 5, businesses with 100 or more workers are to require employees to be vaccinated. If they are not, they would need to be tested weekly and wear masks while working, with exceptions for those who work alone or mostly outdoors. The rule was to go into effect Jan. 4. The requirement would affect businesses with a cumulative 84 million employees, and OSHA projected it could save 6,500 lives and prevent 250,000 hospitalizations over six months.\nWho\u2019s challenging it: The requirement is being challenged by 27 Republican-led state governments plus conservative and business groups and some individual businesses. The states mostly filed lawsuits in groups, though Indiana challenged it alone. Their arguments include that it\u2019s the job of states, not the federal government, to deal with public health measures. The Biden administration maintains that the measure is legal. Some labor unions also contested the rule, though not for the same reasons as the Republicans and business group. They say it doesn't go far enough to protect workers.\nWhere it stands: The rule is on hold. A day after states challenged the rule, a panel of three judges in the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals blocked it. At first, it was a temporary suspension, then a more permanent one. The legal challenges originally were filed in various U.S. appeals courts. The cases subsequently were consolidated into a court that was selected at random, the Cincinnati-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\nWhat\u2019s next: The Biden administration is asking the 6th Circuit to set aside the order from the 5th Circuit and allow the vaccine requirement. In the meantime, OSHA has suspended implementation of the rule. Groups that are suing want the questions decided by all the judges on the 6th Circuit rather than a panel of just some of them.\nHEALTH WORKER MANDATE\nWhat it would do:: Under a rule published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid on Nov. 5, a wide range of health care providers that receive federal Medicare or Medicaid funding were to require workers to receive the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine by Dec. 6 and be fully vaccinated by Jan. 4. The rule would affect more than 17 million workers in about 76,000 health care facilities and home health care providers.\nWho's challenging it: The rule was challenged in four separate lawsuits filed by Republican-led states, mostly in groups. Florida and Texas mounted their own challenges. The states argued that there were no grounds for an emergency rule, that CMS had no clear legal authority to issue the mandate and that the rule infringes on states' responsibilities. \nWhere it stands: The rule is on hold. A Missouri-based federal judge issued a preliminary injunction Monday barring its enforcement in 10 states that had originally sued. The next day, a Louisiana-based federal judge also issued a preliminary injunction barring enforcement in the rest of the states.\nWhat's next: Both court rulings are being appealed by the Biden administration. The case filed in Missouri is being considered by the St. Louis-based 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The case filed in Louisiana, which was brought by a coalition of 14 states, is being considered by the 5th Circuit. So far, there's been no move to consolidate the challenges in a single court.\nFEDERAL CONTRACTOR MANDATE\nWhat would it do: Under an executive order issued by Biden on Sept. 9, contractors and subcontractors for the federal government are required to comply with workplace safety guidelines developed by a federal task force. That task force on Sept. 24 issued guidelines requiring that new, renewed or extended contracts include a clause requiring employees to be fully vaccinated by Dec. 8. That deadline for full vaccination subsequently was delayed until Jan. 18. There are limited exceptions for medical or religions reasons. The requirements could apply to millions of employees.\nWho's challenging it: The guidelines have been challenged through more than a dozen lawsuits, including seven brought by Republican-led states or coalitions of states. The arguments are similar to those against other vaccine mandates, asserting the Biden administration exceeded the procurement rule-making powers granted by Congress, infringed on states' responsibilities and didn't properly gather public comment.\nWhere it stands: A federal judge in Kentucky issued a preliminary injuncting Tuesday barring enforcement of the vaccine requirement for contractors in three states that collectively sued \u2014 Kentucky, Ohio and Tennessee. Judges in Mississippi and Washington state have declined to block the requirements; the question is pending before other courts.\nWhat's next: Legal challenges pending in several other states could lead to additional court rulings this month on requests for injunctions. The Kentucky ruling also could be appealed. Barring a nationwide court order, there could be a patchwork of requirements for contractors depending on the states where they work.\nA quick consolidation of the federal contractor lawsuits appears unlikely.7 Travel Stocks to Buy as Summer Kicks Into High GearThe last 18 months have created much uncertainty in the market. And it has been a catalyst for the gamification of stock trading. However, there was one prediction that looked like a good bet then and does even more so now. That prediction was that Americans would begin to travel en masse as soon as they possibly could.\n\nWhile America may not be back to a pre-pandemic normal, it\u2019s much closer than it was just six months ago. And Americans are making investors in travel stocks very happy.\n\nBut is this a case of the easy gains being gone? Should investors be concerned about the Delta variant of the novel coronavirus that is causing public health restrictions to be enacted in certain areas of the world?\n\nAt this point, neither of those statements seems to be true. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve put together this special presentation that focuses on travel stocks. We\u2019ve looked at different sectors of the travel category and selected a sample of companies whose stocks look like good investments for the rest of 2021 and likely beyond.\nView the \"7 Travel Stocks to Buy as Summer Kicks Into High Gear\"."

The city is close to breaking a record for its longest streak ever without snow. (AP Photo/Brittany Peterson)\nDENVER (AP) \u2014 Denver's winter has started with a whimper, and the parched mountains to the west aren't faring much better.\nThe Mile High City has already shattered its 87-year-old record for the latest measurable snowfall set on Nov. 21, 1934, and it's a little more than a week away from breaking an 1887 record of 235 consecutive days without snow.\nThe scenario is playing out across much of the Rocky Mountains, as far north as Montana and in the broader Western United States, which is experiencing a megadrought that studies link to human-caused climate change. It's only the second time since 1976 that Salt Lake City has gone snowless through November, and amid the unseasonably warm weather in Montana, a late-season wildfire fueled by strong winds ripped through a tiny central Montana farming town this week. \nThe warm and dry weather has drawn crowds to restaurant and bar patios in Denver, and the city\u2019s parks and trails have been bustling with people basking in the sunshine in shorts, short sleeves and occasionally flip flops.\nAs enjoyable as the weather is, climate scientists and meteorologists are warning that prolonged drought could threaten the region\u2019s water supply and agriculture industry. It also could hurt tourism, which relies heavily on skiers, snowboarders, rafters and anglers. \n\u201cEvery day that goes by that we don\u2019t see precipitation show up and we see this year-to-year persistence of drought conditions, it just adds to a deficit. And we continue to add to this deficit year after year, particularly in the Colorado River Basin,\u201d said Keith Musselman, a hydrologist at the University of Colorado-Boulder.\nDerek Greenough moved to Denver a few months ago and immediately bought a snowboard with the hope of soon hitting the slopes. But on Wednesday, he was enjoying the warm weather in a city park.\n\u201cI\u2019m from central New York so I expected it to be somewhat like there, which they have about 5 feet of snow right now,\u201d said Greenough, 27, who was wearing a tank top and exercise shorts. \u201cToday I figured that on the first day of December it would be snowing, at least something, but here we are. It\u2019s a nice day. ... I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be snowboarding anytime soon.\u201d\nDenver\u2019s high Wednesday hit 73 degrees Fahrenheit (23 degrees Celsius), tying the record set in 1973. The National Weather Service is predicting similar conditions over the weekend with only a slight chance of snow at the beginning of next week. \nFrank Cooper, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Boulder, Colorado, said a La Nina weather pattern is pushing storm tracks farther north into the Pacific Northwest and Canada, allowing highs in the Denver area to reach into the 70s. \n\u201cBasically, we haven\u2019t had any systems really able to get into the area to cool us off,\u201d he said, noting that the average high in Denver this time of year is 45 degrees Fahrenheit (7 degrees Celsius).\nMusselman likens mountain snowpack to a natural reservoir that holds moisture during the winter months and releases it in the spring and summer when demand from trees, plants, animals and humans is greater. \n\u201cThat natural reservoir is being affected by climate change, and warming is reducing the amount of snow that\u2019s occurring in the mountains,\u201d he said.\nThe lack of snow in northern Utah is a rarity but the record for the latest snowfall \u2014 set twice on Christmas Day in 1939 and 1943 \u2014 is likely to stand with snow expected sometime late next week, National Weather Service meteorologist David Church said. \nThe mountains near Salt Lake City that are home to several ski resorts had a good start to the season when a wet October that dropped rain in the valley made snow in the mountains, but that\u2019s slowed in November. Several resorts, including Deer Valley in Park City and Powder Mountain and Snowbasin near Ogden, have delayed opening because of the weather.\nWith most of Utah stuck in an extreme drought, a wet winter is more important than just making sure skiers have good runs.\n\u201cWe need a good winter for snowpack out here, so hopefully we can turn the corner as we head into December and January,\u201d Church said.\nThe lack of snow has also led to a mild inversion in the Salt Lake City area, a phenomenon in Utah\u2019s urban corridor caused by weather and geography when cold, stagnant air settles in the bowl-shaped mountain basins, trapping automotive and other emissions and creating a brown, murky haze. Storms break up those inversions.\nIn western Wyoming, Jackson Hole Mountain Resort opened on Thanksgiving, using manmade snow on a handful of low-elevation runs and in an area for children and other inexperienced skiers.\nResort spokesman Eric Seymour said, \u201cwe're not sounding the alarm yet,\u201d and he is keeping his fingers crossed that snow forecast for this weekend will allow the upper mountain to open.\nThat has been the attitude at most Rockies ski resorts, which recognize that the season is just getting underway and that all hope is not lost. Even so, one popular Colorado ski town isn't leaving anything to chance.\nWith such a dearth of skiable terrain open at resorts across the state, Breckenridge is set to hold an annual festival downtown to honor Ullr, the Norse God of Snow and the Patron Saint of Skiers.\nLauren Swanson, a spokeswoman for Breckenridge's tourism office, described the four-day festival starting Dec. 9 as \u201ca town-wide snow dance,\u201d parade and party to thank Ullr for bountiful snow and to ask him to bring more.\n\u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that our snow dances and all of our celebrations will inspire Ullr to bless us with a big storm soon. That\u2019s what this is all about. If the snow is not here, we\u2019ll bring it with our energy,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe in it. I do think it works.\u201d\n___\nAssociated Press writers Brady McCombs in Salt Lake City and Mead Gruver in Cheyenne, Wyoming, contributed to this report.\n___\nThe Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

Stocks are moving tentatively higher in early trading on Wall Street Friday, Dec. 3, as traders struggle to parse data from a report on the U.S. job market. (AP Photo/John Minchillo, File)\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Wall Street is slumping on Friday following a mixed reading on U.S. jobs, one that investors said was tough to parse, in the market's latest bout of dizzying trading. \nThe S&P 500 was 1% lower in afternoon trading after erasing an early gain. It\u2019s coming off a jolting stretch where it swerved by at least 1.2% in five straight days, pounded by uncertainty about how badly the newest coronavirus variant will hit the economy and about when the Federal Reserve will halt its immense support for financial markets. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 118 points, or 0.3%, at 34,521 after earlier pinballing from a gain of 161 points to a loss of 271. The Nasdaq composite was 2.3% lower, as of 12:37 p.m. Eastern time. \nTreasury yields fell, rose and then fell again as investors struggled to square what the jobs report means the Federal Reserve will do on interest rates. The erratic movements fit right in with a week where the S&P 500 swung from a 1.9% gain to a 1.2% loss in one day. \n\u201cWe got some mixed messages on the data\" from the jobs report, \"and that can make for some messy markets,\u201d said Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist at Allspring Global Investments.\nThe report, which is usually the most anticipated economic data by Wall Street each month, showed employers added only 210,000 jobs last month. It was a disappointing result when economists were expecting much stronger hiring of 530,000, and it raised worries the economy may stagnate while inflation remains high. That's a worse-case scenario called \u201cstagflation\u201d by economists, and the omicron variant's arrival makes its likelihood more uncertain. \nBut other areas of the jobs report showed better strength. More people are coming back to the workforce, and the unemployment rate improved to 4.2% from 4.6%. \nThose encouraging numbers helped Treasury yields briefly climb during the morning. But they also came from a section of the jobs report that usually takes a back seat in investors' eyes to the jobs-growth figure. That's because they come from different surveys, one of employers and the other of households, and many investors see the job-growth numbers as the more reliable ones historically.\n\u201cToday\u2019s non-farm payroll report looks messy to me,\u201d said Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group. \u201cBest to wait for the revisions next month before sounding the stagflation alarm too loudly.\u201d\nAmid the messiness, some investors said the jobs report could ultimately push the Fed to get more aggressive about raising short-term interest rates off their record low. Others, though, said they expected the mixed report to have no effect, and the wide differences in opinion helped lead to the day's sharp swings in the market. \nWhat the Fed decides is a huge deal for stocks because low interest rates have been one of the main reasons the S&P 500 has roughly doubled since the early days of the pandemic. Low rates encourage borrowers to spend more and investors to pay higher prices for stocks. \nThe Fed has already begun slowing, or tapering, its program to buy billions of dollars of bonds each month to support the economy and markets. Chair Jerome Powell jolted markets earlier this week when he said the Fed could wrap up its bond-buying program months before the June target it had been on pace for. That would open the door for the Fed to make the more impactful decision of raising short-term rates.\n\u201cWith the headlines on omicron and then figuring out if a faster taper also means a sooner hike \u2014 and investors worrying if the Fed is going to make a mistake \u2014 it's to be expected we\u2019re going to see some of this volatility,\u201d said Allspring Global Investments' Jacobsen. \nConsider the yield on the two-year Treasury, which is heavily influenced by investors' expectations for upcoming Fed actions. It fell from 0.62% to 0.58% immediately after the jobs report's release, before it rebounded back to 0.65%. By early afternoon, it was back down to 0.60%. That's down from the 0.63% level it was at late Thursday.\nThe 10-year Treasury yield, which moves more on investors' expectations for upcoming economic growth and inflation, was likewise unsteady. It zig-zagged from nearly 1.43% to 1.40% to 1.46% immediately after the jobs report's release. It was recently at 1.38%, down from 1.44% Thursday evening. \nSlightly more than half the stocks in the S&P 500 were falling, with some of Wall Street's biggest recent stars offering the heaviest weights.\nMicrosoft, Nvidia and Tesla all fell by at least 2.7%. They were part of a turnaround for high-growth companies that earlier had led the market on expectations they could keep growing even if the economy was slow. \nMarkets were also mixed across Europe and Asia. Germany's DAX lost 0.6%, while Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 1%. \nHong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 0.1%. Chinese ride-hailing service Didi Global Inc. said Friday it will pull out of the New York Stock Exchange and shift its listing to Hong Kong as the ruling Communist Party tightens control over tech industries.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has moved to require that U.S.-listed foreign stocks like Didi's disclose their ownership structures and audit reports, which could lead to some of them being delisted. \nMarkets around the world have swung through the week as investors struggle to handicap how much damage the newest coronavirus variant will ultimately do to the economy. \nWith few concrete answers about omicron, investors have been groping and sending markets back and forth as minor clues dribble out. Still to be determined are whether current vaccines are effective against the variant, whether people will be scared away from businesses because of it and whether already high inflation will worsen due to it. \n___\nAP Business Writer Elaine Kurtenbach contributed. 7 Tech Stocks That Will Avoid Government RegulationAs if investing in the tech sector did not carry enough risk, there\u2019s a new threat to the tech part of your portfolio. There is a growing sense that the United States Congress will seek to regulate some of the largest tech companies.\n\nAt this point, it looks like several of the FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet/Google) may be the initial targets. Some regulation, particularly regarding data security and privacy \u2013 not to mention censorship - would be welcome. But we all know it\u2019s not likely to stop there.\n\nWhat will more extreme regulation look like? If the most vocal members of Congress hold sway, some of these companies may get broken up or face utility-like regulation. From an investment standpoint, it just adds uncertainty.\n\nThe good news is that the tech sector encompasses many companies that are likely to avoid government regulation. With areas like cybersecurity, support for remote work, and mobile gaming to continue to pick up steam, there are other areas that can help boost your portfolio.\n\nAnd in this special presentation, we\u2019ll give you seven of our picks for tech stocks that will avoid government regulation.\nView the \"7 Tech Stocks That Will Avoid Government Regulation\"."

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Sen. Bernie Sanders is asking the White House to cut back a big Medicare premium hike set to take effect in weeks and tied to a pricey Alzheimer's drug whose benefits have been widely questioned. \nIn a letter Friday to President Joe Biden, the Vermont Independent called on the president to act immediately to prevent the portion of an \u201coutrageous increase\u201d in Medicare premiums that's attributable to Aduhelm, a newly approved Alzheimer's medicine from drugmaker Biogen priced at $56,000 a year.\nIf Biden agreed and found a way to do it, a planned January increase of $21.60 a month to Medicare's \u201cPart B\u201d premium for outpatient care would be slashed closer to $10. The monthly premium for 2022 would drop from $170.10 to about $159. \nDemocrats run the risk that seniors smarting from one of the biggest increases ever in Medicare premiums will turn against them in the 2022 midterm elections. The premium increase will claw back a big chunk of next year's Social Security cost-of-living allowance, a boost that works out to $92 a month for the average retired worker, to help cover rising prices for gas and food.\n\u201cBiogen\u2019s $56,000 price of Aduhelm is the poster child for how dysfunctional our prescription drug pricing system has become,\u201d Sanders wrote to Biden. \u201cThe notion that one pharmaceutical company can raise the price of one drug so much that it could negatively impact 57 million senior citizens and the future of Medicare is beyond absurd. With Democrats in control of the White House, the House and the Senate we cannot let that happen.\u201d A copy of the letter was provided to The Associated Press.\nThere was no immediate comment from the White House. \nSanders' letter comes as Democrats have had to step back from their dream of delivering dental and vision coverage to Medicare recipients as part of Biden's sweeping social agenda legislation. They've also had to narrow the scope of price negotiations with drug companies, although coverage for hearing aids stayed in the bill. Even if the legislation passes, its benefits will phase in over time and would not be available right away. But the premium hike would hit after the New Year.\nSanders wrote that \u201cit could not come at a worse time for older Americans all over this country who are struggling economically.\u201d\nThe jump of $21.60 in monthly Medicare premiums is the biggest increase ever in dollar terms, although not percentage-wise. As recently as August, the Medicare Trustees\u2019 report had projected a smaller increase of $10 from the current $148.50. Medicare said it had to boost the rate higher to set aside a contingency fund in case the program formally approves coverage for Aduhelm.\nAlzheimer\u2019s is a progressive neurological disease with no known cure, affecting about 6 million Americans, the vast majority old enough to qualify for Medicare.\nAduhelm is the first Alzheimer\u2019s medication in nearly 20 years, although it doesn\u2019t cure the disease. The Food and Drug Administration approved the drug this summer, determining that Aduhelm's ability to reduce clumps of plaque in the brain is likely to slow dementia. That decision was highly controversial, since the FDA overrode its own outside advisers. Many experts say Aduhelm's benefit has not been clearly demonstrated. The Department of Veterans Affairs declined to list the medicine on its roster of approved drugs.\nMedicare has begun a formal assessment to determine whether it should cover the drug, and a final decision isn\u2019t likely until at least the spring. For now, Medicare is deciding on a case-by-case basis whether to pay for Aduhelm.\nSanders asked Biden to order Medicare to hold off on approving coverage of Aduhelm until there is scientific consensus about its benefits.\nBiogen has defended its pricing, saying it looked carefully at costs of advanced medications to treat cancer and other conditions. A nonprofit think tank focused on drug pricing pegged Adulhelm\u2019s actual value at between $3,000 and $8,400 per year \u2014 not $56,000 \u2014 based on its unproven benefits.7 Electric Vehicle Stocks That Are Ready to Charge HigherThe Biden administration has announced a framework for a slimmed-down $1.5 trillion infrastructure bill. Part of that framework will be a $12,500 tax credit for electric vehicle purchases. That increases the current subsidy by $4,500. And it\u2019s music to the ears of EV companies in the United States who are making plans to scale production.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean the country is close to having an EV in every driveway. There is still the issue of a charging infrastructure. The chip shortage will be a headwind on auto production of all types for at least the next several quarters. And many EV companies are not even on the starting blocks yet.\n\nBut It does mean that momentum is building. And for investors who retreated to the sideline after the EV bubble burst in early 2021, it may be time to get back in the game.\n\nIn this special presentation, we\u2019re looking at seven stocks that stand to benefit from these subsidies in the United States.

(AP Photo/Hassan Ammar)\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 The head of the Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One racing team apologized Friday for the way the team announced its partnership with a company involved in a London high-rise where a fire killed 72 people.\nThe team announced a sponsorship deal this week allowing building products maker Kingspan to put its logo on the nose cone of world champion Lewis Hamilton\u2019s car beginning with a weekend race in Saudi Arabia. \nSurvivors and family members of the people who died in the 2017 Grenfell Tower fire immediately condemned the deal and asked the team to sever its ties with Kingspan. The fire started in a fourth floor refrigerator and raced up the residential building, which experts said likely was caused by flammable materials used in an exterior renovation.\nMercedes-AMG Petronas principal and CEO Toto Wolff said the team \u201cengaged\u201d with Kingspan before the announcement to understand what role the company\u2019s products played in the tragedy. \n\u201cOn behalf of our team, I would sincerely like to apologize to you for the additional hurt that this announcement has caused,\u2019\u2019 Wolff said in a letter to the families that was posted on Twitter. \u201cIt was never our intention to do so.\u2019\u2019\nWolff said he hoped to meet with Grenfell Tower survivors as soon as possible.\nCriticism of the deal is particularly difficult for Mercedes because Hamilton, a seven-time world champion from Stevenage, England, has been outspoken in his support of the Grenfell community. Hamilton is currently in second place in the Formula One driver\u2019s standings with two races left in the season.\nIn a letter sent to Wolff earlier this week, the community group Grenfell United said Kingspan \u201cplayed a central role in the pain and suffering that we feel today,\u201d citing evidence presented to a public inquiry into the disaster. \nKingspan said it played no role in the design or construction of the remodeling project blamed for the Grenfell disaster. In addition, the company said Kingspan products accounted for only a small percentage of the insulation used in the project, and it was used as a substitute without the company\u2019s knowledge \u201cin a system that was not compliant\u201d with building regulations.\nWolff acknowledged the \u201cdeep and ongoing pain\u201d suffered by survivors\n\u201cI would like to thank Grenfell United for the offer to meet in person for me to learn and understand better,\u2019\u2019 Wolff said \u201cI look forward to coming together as soon as we can.\u2019\u20197 Fintech Stocks That Will Continue To Disrupt Traditional BankingIn April 2021, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon described fintech companies as one of the \u201cenormous competitive threats\u201d to traditional banking. And with good reason. Fintech (short for financial technology) is not just \u201cdigital banking.\u201d It\u2019s a different approach to banking that traditional banks will not be able to replicate by outspending their competitors.\n\nYou see, cryptocurrency is getting a lot of attention for the way it\u2019s disrupting the monetary system. But before there was bitcoin (CCC: BTC-USD), there was fintech.\n\nWhat started out as a way to send money from one person to another without the need for a bank (i.e. peer-to-peer lending) has morphed into much more. Today, individuals and businesses can get loans, invest, and pay bills conveniently and securely. And they can do so without ever having to set foot into a bank.\n\nFinancial technology is democratizing finance for many individuals who have been left behind by the traditional banking system. The \u201cunbanked\u201d is a huge target audience. But whereas fintech started as reaching those that were unbanked out of necessity; it is cultivating a new audience among those who are going unbanked by choice.\n\nIn this special presentation, we\u2019ll look at seven fintech companies that are leading in this space today and will do so well into the future.\nView the \"7 Fintech Stocks That Will Continue To Disrupt Traditional Banking\"."

Economists say global markets are unlikely to be affected but banks and bondholders might suffer because Beijing wants to avoid a bailout.\nAfter reviewing Evergrande\u2019s finances, \u201cthere is no guarantee that the Group will have sufficient funds to continue to perform its financial obligations,\u201d the company said in a statement through the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.\nShortly after that, regulators tried to soothe investor fears by issuing statements saying China\u2019s financial system was strong and that default rates are low. They said most developers are financially healthy and that Beijing will keep lending markets functioning.\n\u201cThe spillover impact of the group\u2019s risk events on the stable operation of the capital market is controllable,\u201d the China Securities Regulatory Commission said on its website. The central bank and bank regulator issued similar statements.\nBeijing tightened restrictions on developers\u2019 use of borrowed money last year in a campaign to rein in surging corporate debt that is seen as a threat to economic stability.\nThe ruling Communist Party has made reducing financial risk a priority since 2018. In 2014, authorities allowed the first corporate bond default since the 1949 communist revolution. Defaults have gradually been allowed to increase in hopes of forcing borrowers and investors to be more disciplined.\nDespite that, total corporate, government and household debt rose from the equivalent of 270% of annual economic output in 2018 to nearly 300% last year, unusually high for a middle-income country. Economists say a financial crisis is unlikely but debt could drag on economic growth.\nEvergrande, the global real estate industry\u2019s biggest debtor, owes 2 trillion yuan ($310 billion), mostly to domestic banks and bond investors. It also owes $19 billion to foreign bondholders.\nEvergrande said it has 2.3 trillion yuan ($350 billion) in assets, but the company has struggled to turn that into cash to pay bondholders and other creditors. It called off the $2.6 billion sale of a stake in a subsidiary last October because the buyer failed to follow through on its purchase.\nEvergrande\u2019s statement Friday said the company faces a demand to fulfill a $260 million obligation. It said if that obligation cannot be met, other creditors might demand repayment of debts earlier than normal.\nThe company has missed deadlines to pay interest on some bonds but made payments before a grace period ended and was declared in default. Evergrande also said some bondholders can choose to be paid by receiving apartments that are under construction.\nThe Evergrande chairman, Xu Jiayin, was summoned to meet Friday with officials of its home province of Guangdong, a government statement said. The statement said a government team would be sent to Evergrande headquarters to help oversee risk management.\nEvergrande\u2019s struggle has prompted warnings that a financial squeeze on real estate \u2014 an industry that propelled China\u2019s explosive 1998-2008 economic boom \u2014 could lead to trouble for banks and an abrupt and politically dangerous collapse in growth.\nAlso Friday, another developer, Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd., warned it might fail to pay off a $400 million bond due next week. \nA midsize developer, Fantasia Holdings Group, announced Oct. 5 that it failed to make a $205.7 million payment due to bondholders.\nHundreds of smaller Chinese developers have gone bankrupt since regulators began tightening control over the industry\u2019s finances in 2017.\nThe slowdown in construction helped to depress China\u2019s economic growth an unexpectedly low 4.9% over a year earlier in the three months ending in September. Forecasters expect growth to decelerate further if the financing curbs stay in place.7 Defensive Stocks to Buy on Market JittersDefensive stocks are companies that deliver consistent revenue and earnings regardless of what is happening in the broader economy. This has the effect of allowing these stocks to outperform the market when the economy is in a downturn. But it also means that these stocks are frequently overlooked during bull markets.\n\nAfter all, for many investors, particularly younger investors, but the benefit of capturing a dividend is far down on their list of priorities.

Flush with cash during the pandemic, many Americans took to shopping online as part of their new normal. Demand quickly outpaced supply, particularly as many factories were dealing with labor shortages due to Covid-19 restrictions.\n\nWhile that may oversimplify the problem with the global supply chain, there\u2019s little doubt that e-commerce transactions have made an impact. In fact, e-commerce was one of the fastest-growing segments of the economy prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. It\u2019s part of the continuing digitization of the economy. And that makes it a segment that investors can\u2019t afford to ignore.\n\nJust how much of an impact does e-commerce make? In 2020 alone, there were 454 billion transactions worldwide totaling $4.2 trillion in sales. But that only tells part of the story. As big as that number is, it makes up less than 20% (17.8%) of all retail sales worldwide. A large number of those transactions go through Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nHowever, if you missed out on buying Amazon when it was still \u201cjust\u201d an online bookseller, you may find a share price of over $3,000 per share a little tough to swallow. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve put together this special presentation. We\u2019ve identified seven companies that are likely to perform well despite the current supply chain crisis and have business models that will be sustainable even when supply and demand get back into balance.\nView the \"7 E-Commerce Stocks That Aren\u2019t Tangled in the Supply Chain\"."

(AP Photo/Gerry Broome, File)\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Growth in the services sector, where most Americans work, hit an all-time high in November, overtaking a record that was set the previous month. \nThe Institute for Supply Management reported Friday that its monthly survey of service industries increased by 2.4 percentage points in November from the October record to a reading of 69.1 percent. Any reading above 50 indicates growth.\nThe service sector data is being released against the backdrop of an employment landscape in which hiring appeared to slow in November, but the unemployment rate tumbled from 4.6% to 4.2%. That is a historically low jobless rate though still above the pre-pandemic level of 3.5%.\nSome of the strength in the services sector is coming from supply chain troubles that are making it harder to meet increased demand. Those troubles are showing up in the index as longer supplier delivery times and rising prices which register as strengths for the services sector.\nThe recent uptick in COVID-19 cases and now the appearance of the new omicron variant could depress service sector activity in coming months.\n\u201cWe suspect this survey is overstating the outlook for the services sector, particularly as rising coronavirus infection rates in the Northwest and Midwest will weight on high-contact services activity over the winter,\u201d said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist for Capital Economics.\nThe increase in November was led by a rise in the business activity index and a gain in the employment index. The new orders index remained at an elevated reading of 69.7.\nAll 18 service sector industries reported growth in November and since recording two months of contraction last year in April and May when the pandemic was raging, the overall index has now grown for 18 consecutive months. \nAnthony Nieves, head of the ISM services sector survey committee, said the responses for the November report were gathered before reports started coming out about the new omicron variant. He said while the new variant could impact service sector activity it will depend on how widespread the new variant is and how much it increases infections.\nThe responses from service sector businesses showed that the supply chain delays and difficulty finding workers were having a widespread impact.\nOne survey respondent in food services pointed to \u201clabor shortages, transportation delays and supply constraints\u201d as big issues.\nOren Klachen, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, predicted that \u201csubstantial supply side restraints will continue to cap the expansion even if omicron doesn't prove to be a significant threat.\u201d7 Undervalued Stocks in an Overvalued MarketIn June 2021 the investment firm, Bespoke Investments made this ominous pronouncement: \u201cInvestors simultaneously think the market is overvalued, but likely to keep climbing.\u201d\n\nThis statement was meant to be a warning to investors. However, investors have shown that they can be very resilient even as the major indices continue to reach new highs.\n\nSo it would seem strange to be looking at a list of undervalued stocks. But looking at undervalued stocks is a form of value investing. And in 2021, investors are shifting between growth and value investing on a monthly, if not weekly basis.\n\nAn undervalued stock is one that is considered to be trading below its fair value. However, there\u2019s no singular right way to identify undervalued stocks. Some investors prefer to look at fundamental metrics. Others will look for technical signals.\n\nThe one common element of all undervalued stocks is that they are stocks that have room to grow. That\u2019s something that all investors can get behind.

Stocks are moving tentatively higher in early trading on Wall Street Friday, Dec. 3, as traders struggle to parse data from a report on the U.S. job market. (AP Photo/John Minchillo, File)\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Stocks are churning lower on Wall Street Friday after a mixed reading on U.S. jobs led to zig-zag trading, the latest abrupt U-turns for markets following an already dizzying week. \nThe S&P 500 fell 1% in morning trading after giving up an early gain of 0.7%. It\u2019s coming off a jolting stretch where it swerved by at least 1.2% in five straight days, pounded by uncertainty about how badly the newest coronavirus variant will hit the economy and about when the Federal Reserve will halt its immense support for financial markets. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 240 points, or 0.7%, at 34,406. It was up as much as 161 points earlier. The Nasdaq composite was 2.1% lower as of 10:50 a.m. Eastern time. \nTreasury yields were mixed, while a gauge of fear among U.S. stock investors went from easing to worsening quickly after trading began in New York. The erratic movements fit right in with a week where the S&P 500 swung from a 1.9% gain to a 1.2% loss in one day. \nYields initially sank after the U.S. government said employers added only 210,000 jobs last month, less than half the 530,000 that economists expected. The jobs report is usually the most anticipated economic data on Wall Street each month.\nBut they quickly zoomed back upward as other areas of the jobs report showed better strength. More people are coming back to the workforce, and the unemployment rate improved to 4.2% from 4.6%. Those encouraging trends may help quell worries the economy will stagnate even while inflation remains high, a worst-case scenario that economists call \u201cstagflation.\u201d\n\u201cToday\u2019s non-farm payroll report looks messy to me,\u201d said Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group. \u201cBest to wait for the revisions next month before sounding the stagflation alarm too loudly.\u201d\nInvestors, of course, were still quick to extrapolate very different reactions from the mixed report. Some said that it could push the Fed to speed up its removal of support from markets, while others said they expected no effect. \nThe Fed jolted markets earlier this week when its chair said the central bank will consider wrapping up its bond-buying program a few months earlier than the June target it had been on pace for. That would open the door for the Fed to raise short-term interest rates off their record low, one of the main reasons the S&P 500 has roughly doubled since the early days of the pandemic. Low rates encourage borrowers to spend more and investors to pay higher prices for stocks.\nThe competing schools of thought initially pushed the yield on the two-year Treasury down to 0.58% before it rebounded back to 0.65%. By mid-morning, it was back at 0.63%, where it was late Thursday.\nThe 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.43%, down from 1.44% Thursday evening. But that's only after it zig-zagged from nearly 1.43% to 1.40% to 1.46% immediately after the jobs report's release. \nStocks were also mixed across Europe and Asia. Germany's DAX lost 0.4%, while Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 1%. \nHong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 0.1%. Chinese ride-hailing service Didi Global Inc. said Friday it will pull out of the New York Stock Exchange and shift its listing to Hong Kong as the ruling Communist Party tightens control over tech industries.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has moved to require that U.S.-listed foreign stocks like Didi's disclose their ownership structures and audit reports, which could lead to some of them being delisted. \nIn another blow for China's troubled property sector, Hong Kong-traded developer Kaisa Group said it had failed to get the required approvals from bond holders to extend the deadline on payment on $400 million of 6.5% offshore bonds. It had wanted to have the new notes be due on June 6, 2023 at the same interest rate. \nThe aim was to relieve financial pressure and the plan's failure to go through raises the risk of a default. \nMarkets around the world have swung through the week as investors struggle to handicap how much damage the newest coronavirus variant will ultimately do to the economy. \nWith few concrete answers about omicron, investors have been groping and sending markets back and forth as minor clues dribble out. Still to be determined are whether current vaccines are effective against the variant, whether people will be scared away from businesses because of it and whether already high inflation will worsen due to it. \n___\nAP Business Writer Elaine Kurtenbach contributed. 7 Growth Stocks to Buy as the Market SlumpsAt times of volatility, it can be hard for even experienced investors to stay the course. Yet over time, stocks have consistently increased in value. And growth stocks tend to be among the ones that show the largest gains. Growth stocks are companies that analysts believe will grow at a rate that is significantly above the market average.\n\nThese stocks are also characterized by companies that invest a significant portion of its profits back into its business in order to accelerate growth. This is opposed to value stocks that make returning a portion of its profits to shareholders a priority. This typically occurs in the form of a dividend.\nOne misconception of growth stocks is that they have a high correlation with the market. It\u2019s true that when the market is moving higher, these stocks tend to outperform. However, when the market is moving lower, these stocks sometimes perform better.\n\nSo why should you consider buying growth stocks now? The reason is this. In many cases, the company\u2019s underlying fundamentals are still positive, but the sentiment has changed. And that means it\u2019s a good time to buy these stocks on sale.

        "Article": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 Royal Dutch Shell has pulled out of a controversial plan to develop a new oil field near Scotland\u2019s Shetland Islands, buoying environmentalists\u2019 hopes that the project may be shelved altogether as Britain seeks to combat global warming.\nShell, which had a 30% stake in the Cambo project, said Friday that the decision was based on an assessment of what was best for the company and its shareholders.\nThe project has faced stiff opposition from groups such as Greenpeace, which argue Britain must stop developing new oil and gas fields if it is serious about reducing carbon emissions. U.K. authorities granted an exploration license for the project in 2001 and the government is now considering whether to authorize commercial operations.\n\u201cAfter comprehensive screening of the proposed Cambo development, we have concluded the economic case for investment in this project is not strong enough at this time, as well as the potential for having delays,\u201d Shell said in a statement. \u201cHowever, continued investment in oil and gas in the U.K. remains critical to the country\u2019s energy security.\u201d\nSiccar Point Energy, Cambo\u2019s controlling partner, said it still planned to move ahead with the project. Developing the field 125 kilometers (78 miles) west of the Shetland Islands will create 1,000 jobs and help ease the U.K.\u2019s transition to a low-carbon economy, Chief Executive Jonathan Roger said in a statement.\n\u201cWe will continue to engage with the U.K. government and wider stakeholders on the future development of Cambo,\u201d he said.\nThe Cambo field will produce up to 170 million barrels of oil and 53.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas over 25 years, according to Siccar Point. \nPhilip Evans, a campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said Shell\u2019s departure from the project should prompt the government to think again.\n\u201cWith yet another key player turning its back on the scheme, the government is cutting an increasingly lonely figure with their continued support for the oil field,\u201d he said.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson came under pressure to block the Cambo project as he sought to lead the global fight against global warming as host of last month\u2019s UN Climate Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, known as COP26.\nThe International Energy Agency has said policy makers shouldn\u2019t approve the development of any new oil or natural gas fields if they hope to achieve the UN goal of limiting global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels. The IEA, whose members include the U.S., U.K. and Japan, advises countries around the world on energy issues.\nShell\u2019s decision on Cambo comes as major economies accelerate the shift toward renewable energy and oil companies plan for the day when demand for fossil fuels fades. CEO Ben van Beurden has made it clear that he intends Shell to remain competitive in this new energy landscape.\nNicola Sturgeon, leader of Scotland\u2019s devolved government, said last month that she doesn\u2019t believe Cambo could pass any rigorous assessment of its climate impacts and that the project shouldn\u2019t be allowed to move forward. But approval of the project rests with the central government in London, which has so far refused to block Cambo.\nJohnson\u2019s government has said no new oil and gas production licenses will be granted unless they are aligned with Britain\u2019s climate change objectives. The government is designing a formal \u201cclimate change checkpoint,\u201d which it says will be announced by the end of this year.\nLiam Kerr, a member of the Scottish Parliament from Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party, continued to back Cambo on Friday.\n\u201cCambo will be massively beneficial to our economy, securing our domestic supply of oil and gas while demand is still high,\u201d he said. \u201cThe (oil and gas) industry supports 100,000 Scottish jobs and is crucial to the energy transition.\u201d\nBut Sophie Marjanac of ClientEarth, which seeks to protect the environment through legal action, said the U.K. government\u2019s refusal to rule out new fossil fuel projects is \u201cwholly inconsistent\u201d with its pledges on climate change.\n\u201cNew oil and gas projects are reckless for the climate and the economy,\u201d Marjanac said. \u201cIf the government doesn\u2019t start phasing out U.K. oil and gas and focus on a just transition for workers \u2013 like other major economies promised to do at COP26 \u2013 it\u2019s only setting up the industry for chaotic collapse.\u201d7 Retail Stocks to Buy After Strong Quarterly EarningsEarnings season follows a predictable pattern. Bank stocks report first; then big tech stocks weigh in. And now, late in earnings season, we hear from the retail sector. Investors were expecting strong numbers and, for the most part, retailers delivered.\n\nHowever, for some retailers, this may become a \u201csell the news\u201d event.\n\nThat\u2019s because on August 16, before the big-name retailers reported, the U.S. Retail Sales Report showed a 1.1% decline in retail sales in July from June. So while retail sales for the last two quarters will be strong, investors are wondering if the sector is entering a period of slowing growth. Concern about the Delta variant perhaps bringing more restrictions to the retail sector adds to the concern.\n\nHowever, sectors don\u2019t move in lockstep. In every market, there are strong performers even in tough economic conditions. This was true during the pandemic. And it\u2019s true in the recovery. Summer is traditionally a slower season overall for retail. The July numbers probably do not reflect all of the back-to-school purchases. And, of course, stores are already beginning to prepare for the holiday season.View the \"7 Retail Stocks to Buy After Strong Quarterly Earnings\"."

Stocks are moving tentatively higher in early trading on Wall Street Friday, Dec. 3, as traders struggle to parse data from a report on the U.S. job market. (AP Photo/John Minchillo, File)\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Stocks are churning in mixed trading on Wall Street Friday following a tough-to-parse report on U.S. jobs, as markets continue to swirl at the tail end of a dizzying week.\nThe S&P 500 was 0.1% lower, as of 9:50 a.m. Eastern time, after an early 0.7% gain quickly vanished. It\u2019s coming off a jolting stretch where it swerved at least 1.2% in five straight days, pounded by uncertainty about how badly the newest coronavirus variant will hit the economy and about when the Federal Reserve will halt its immense support for financial markets. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 39 points, or 0.1%, at 34,590 after earlier being up 161 points. The Nasdaq composite was 0.7% lower. \nTreasury yields were modestly higher, while a gauge of fear among U.S. stock investors eased. But those movements were also erratic, fitting right in with a week where the S&P 500 swung from a 1.9% gain to a 1.2% loss in one day. \nYields initially sank after the U.S. government said employers added only 210,000 jobs last month, less than half the 530,000 that economists expected. The jobs report is usually the most anticipated economic data on Wall Street each month.\nBut they quickly swung back upward as other areas of the jobs report showed better strength. More people are coming back to the workforce, and the unemployment rate improved to 4.2% from 4.6%. Those encouraging trends may have helped quell worries the economy will stagnate even while inflation remains high, a worst-case scenario that economists call \u201cstagflation.\u201d\n\u201cToday\u2019s non-farm payroll report looks messy to me,\u201d said Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group. \u201cBest to wait for the revisions next month before sounding the stagflation alarm too loudly.\u201d\nInvestors, of course, were still quick to extrapolate very different reactions from the mixed report. Some said they expected it to push the Fed to speed up its removal of support from markets, while others said they expected no effect. \nThe Fed jolted markets earlier this week when its chair said the central bank will consider wrapping up massive bond-buying program a few months earlier than the June target it had been on pace for. That would open the door for the Fed to raise short-term interest rates off their record low, which has been one of the main reasons for the S&P 500\u2019s roughly doubling in value since the early days of the pandemic. Low rates encourage borrowers to spend more and investors to pay higher prices for stocks.\nThe competing schools of thought initially pushed the yield on the two-year Treasury down to 0.58% before it rebounded back to 0.64%. That's up from 0.63% late Thursday.\nThe 10-year Treasury yield rose to 1.45% from 1.44% after sinking to 1.40% immediately after the jobs report's release. \nStocks were stronger in Europe and Asia. Germany's DAX returned 0.3%, while Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 1%. \nHong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 0.1%. Chinese ride-hailing service Didi Global Inc. said Friday it will pull out of the New York Stock Exchange and shift its listing to Hong Kong as the ruling Communist Party tightens control over tech industries.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has moved to require that U.S.-listed foreign stocks like Didi's disclose their ownership structures and audit reports, which could lead to some of them being delisted. \nIn another blow for China's troubled property sector, Hong Kong-traded developer Kaisa Group said it had failed to get the required approvals from bond holders to extend the deadline on payment on $400 million of 6.5% offshore bonds.

There is a growing sense that the United States Congress will seek to regulate some of the largest tech companies.\n\nAt this point, it looks like several of the FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet/Google) may be the initial targets. Some regulation, particularly regarding data security and privacy \u2013 not to mention censorship - would be welcome.

But she took a part-time job at one of her favorite local restaurants because they were struggling to hire people. Employers have reported a shortage of workers to meet demand as more people return to normal habits following the disruption of the coronavirus pandemic. Aquino sees it as her civic duty to help out local businesses. (AP Photo/Adam Beam)\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 America\u2019s employers slowed the pace of their hiring in November, adding 210,000 jobs, the lowest monthly gain in nearly a year. \nBut Friday\u2019s report from the Labor Department also showed that the nation's unemployment rate tumbled from 4.6% to 4.2% evidence that many more people reported that they had a job. That is a historically low jobless rate though still above the pre-pandemic level of 3.5%.\nOverall, the November jobs figures point to a job market and an economic recovery that look resilient though under threat from a spike in inflation, shortages of workers and supplies and the potential impact of the omicron variant of the coronavirus. \nFor months, employers have been struggling with worker shortages because many people who lost jobs in the pandemic have not, for various reasons, returned to the workforce. But last month, more Americans came off the sidelines to look for jobs and were generally hired quickly.\nThat positive trend suggests that November was a healthier month for job growth than the modest 210,000 gain the government reported Friday in its survey of businesses. The unemployment rate is calculated from a separate survey of households. This survey found that a much larger 1.1 million more people reported that they were employed last month. The results of the two surveys typically match up over the long run but sometimes diverge sharply in a given month, as they did in November. \nThe survey of households found that the number of unemployed Americans sank in November to 6.9 million, not far above the pre-pandemic number of 5.7 million. And average wages, which have been rising as employers try to attract or keep workers, increased a strong 4.8% from a year ago. \nThe government's survey of businesses showed a slowdown last month in hiring at restaurants, bars and hotels, which added just 23,000 jobs, down from 170,000 in October. That could reflect the effects of an uptick in COVID-19 cases last month and a reduction in outdoor dining. \nRetailers cut 20,000 jobs, a sign that holiday hiring hasn't been as strong as in previous years. But transportation and warehousing firms added 50,000 positions, which indicates that online retailers and shippers anticipate healthy online shopping. \nThe jobs outlook for the coming months has become hazier with the emergence of the omicron variant. Little is definitively known about omicron, and widespread business shutdowns are considered unlikely. Still, omicron could discourage some Americans from traveling, shopping and eating out in the coming months and potentially slow the economy.\nFor now, though, Americans are spending freely, and the economy is forecast to expand at a 7% annual rate in the final three months of the year, a big rebound from the 2.1% pace in the previous quarter, when the delta variant hobbled growth. \nNearly 600,000 people joined the workforce last month, increasing the proportion of Americans who are either working or looking for work. If that much-anticipated development continues, it could point to stronger job growth ahead. \nThe proportion of Americans who are in the workforce rose from 61.6% to 61.8%, the first significant increase since April.\nEven as the jobless rate has steadily declined this year, the proportion of Americans who are working or looking for work has barely budged. A shortage of job-seekers tends to limit hiring and force companies to pay more to attract and keep employees. Higher pay can help sustain spending and growth. But it can also feed inflation if businesses raise prices to offset their higher labor costs, which they often do. \nOne result is that there are now about 3.6 million fewer people with jobs than there were before the pandemic. Yet only about one-third of them are actively looking for work and are classified as unemployed. The remaining two-thirds are no longer job-hunting and so aren\u2019t counted as unemployed. The government classifies people as unemployed only if they\u2019re actively seeking work. \nWhether or not more people start searching for jobs is a critical question for the Federal Reserve. If the proportion of people who either have a job or are looking for one doesn\u2019t rise much, it would suggest that the Fed is nearing its goal of maximum employment.\nWith inflation at a three-decade high and far above the Fed\u2019s 2% annual target, reaching its employment mandate would heighten pressure on Chair Jerome Powell to raise interest rates sooner rather than later. Doing so would make loans more expensive for many individuals and businesses.\nAbout half of those who have dropped out of the workforce have retired. The other half includes parents, mostly mothers, who stayed home to care for children during closings of schools and day cares. For some of these women, child care remains unavailable or unaffordable. Some other people have become self-employed. And others continue to delay their job hunts for fear of contracting COVID-19. 7 Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy For a Healthy Portfolio in 2022One year ago, investors expected 2021 to be a huge year for pharmaceutical stocks. The bullish perspective was that as vaccines rolled out and the economy reopened, investors would shift from biotech stocks to traditional pharmaceutical stocks.\n\nBut the Delta variant has kept Covid-19 top of mind for many investors. While it\u2019s true that some pharmaceutical stocks were part of the vaccine race, other players in the space have not performed as well as was hoped. Case in point, as of October 6, 2021, the iShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF (NYSEARCA:IHE) is up only 9.7% in the last 12 months. And if you bought shares of the fund at the beginning of the year, you have no growth to show for your patience.\n\nThere are reasons beyond Covid-19 to consider when assessing the disappointing performance of pharmaceutical stocks. One is the current political climate which is making no secret of its desire to reshape the healthcare industry. And it has the pricing practices of \u201cbig pharma\u201d firmly in its crosshairs.\n\nHowever, the pharmaceutical sector is still loaded with quality stocks for investors who are willing to accept the inherent risk. And that\u2019s the focus of this special presentation. In the next few minutes, we\u2019ll take a look at seven pharmaceutical stocks that\nare ready to make strong moves forward in 2022.View the \"7 Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy For a Healthy Portfolio in 2022\"."

(AP Photo/Francisco Seco)\nANKARA, Turkey (AP) \u2014 Turkey\u2019s beleaguered currency has been plunging to all-time lows against the U.S. dollar and the euro in recent months as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan presses ahead with a widely criticized effort to cut interest rates despite surging consumer prices.\nAs a result, families are struggling to buy food and other goods and the Turkish lira has lost around 40% of its value since the start of the year, becoming one of the world's worst-performing currencies.\nHere is a closer look at the Turkish currency crisis and its impact on a country with eye-popping inflation:\nWHAT IS GOING ON?\nTurkey\u2019s Central Bank has cut borrowing costs by 4 percentage points since September, in line with Erdogan\u2019s wishes, even though inflation accelerated to around 20%.\nErdogan, who has been in power for some 19 years and has grown increasingly authoritarian, has long argued that high interest rates cause inflation, contrary to what economists generally say: that increasing rates will drive down prices. \nThe rate cuts have raised concerns over the bank\u2019s independence, while the country\u2019s unconventional monetary policy has spooked foreign investors, who are dumping Turkish assets. And Turkish citizens are rushing to convert their savings to foreign currencies and gold to protect them from soaring inflation. \n\u201cPeople bring their savings and always want to buy dollars. When will it end, where will this go? They\u2019re panicking,\" said Hulya Orak, a currency exchange office worker. \u201cPeople are constantly in panic mode and are using money that\u2019s under their mattresses.\" \nAs a result, the Turkish lira, which had barely recovered from a currency crisis in 2018, has been weakening to record lows against the dollar and the euro. \nIt crashed to a record low of 13.44 against the American currency on Nov. 23 after Erdogan insisted there would be no turning back from his unconventional policies.

Bank stocks report first; then big tech stocks weigh in. And now, late in earnings season, we hear from the retail sector. Investors were expecting strong numbers and, for the most part, retailers delivered.\n\nHowever, for some retailers, this may become a \u201csell the news\u201d event.\n\nThat\u2019s because on August 16, before the big-name retailers reported, the U.S. Retail Sales Report showed a 1.1% decline in retail sales in July from June. So while retail sales for the last two quarters will be strong, investors are wondering if the sector is entering a period of slowing growth. Concern about the Delta variant perhaps bringing more restrictions to the retail sector adds to the concern.\n\nHowever, sectors don\u2019t move in lockstep. In every market, there are strong performers even in tough economic conditions. This was true during the pandemic. And it\u2019s true in the recovery. Summer is traditionally a slower season overall for retail. The July numbers probably do not reflect all of the back-to-school purchases. And, of course, stores are already beginning to prepare for the holiday season.View the \"7 Retail Stocks to Buy After Strong Quarterly Earnings\"."

        "Article": "By Marissa S\u00e1nchez Why? In addition to joy and good wishes, Christmas represents one of the most dynamic seasons in the economy. And the figures confirm it: consumers in Mexico City, for example, spend an average of 22% of their Christmas bonus for the different parties that are celebrated in December. The main expenses include both the Christmas Eve and New Year 's dinner, as well as the purchase of gifts. According to the Small Chamber of Commerce, Services and Tourism of Mexico City ( Canacope ), these expenses range from $ 3,300. On the other hand, more and more people declare themselves a fan of pets . It is estimated that in the country there are more than 4.5 million dogs living in Mexican homes. Only in the capital of the country, according to the Ministry of Health of the capital, there is one canine for every seven people, that is, 1.2 million dogs. With this, Mexico ranks as the nation with the highest number of dogs and cats in Latin America. According to the national study Mexico a Pet Friendly Country by Mitofsky Consultations, Nayarit, Jalisco, Colima and Michoac\u00e1n are the most pet friendly states after the capital of the country. The dog is the favorite animal of Mexicans with 79% of respondents claiming to have one, followed by cats with 29% of preferences. The study by Consultas Mitofsky shows that 32.4% of Mexicans choose to give their pets special food. New opportunities to start a business may arise from this last piece of information. For example: a New Year's Eve dinner service for pets.  Mexico ranks as the nation with the highest number of dogs and cats in Latin America / Image: Depositphotos.com How? The taste for cooking and pets are the first two ingredients to start this business. It consists of a service to prepare Christmas and New Year's dinners for the new spoils of the home (includes home delivery). Thus, your dog or cat can celebrate with the rest of the family and delight the palate with delicious dishes on these special dates. You can start from home, taking advantage of your kitchen and basic utensils. Just consider about $ 15,000 in cash or a similar line of credit for grocery or grocery ingredients. Take advantage of your first orders to make photo sessions of your creations and with them create a menu that you can put together on a simple Web page that will enamor the eyes of pet owners. It also incorporates online payment options to ensure advance payment of the order. Consider an investment of approximately $ 30,000. Search for clients on the Internet; participate in pet lovers forums and implement a permanent strategy on social networks. And so it's not just a seasonal business, extend your service to pet birthdays, parties, and other special celebrations.

        "Article": "As businesses in nearly every sector focus on digital transformation, more aim to incorporate enterprise blockchain technology into their operations. According to a Deloitte study, more than half of global executives included blockchain among their top strategic priorities in 2020, indicating a growing interest in the technology\u2019s applications across industries and regions.But to turn that interest into real innovation, there\u2019s a lot of work to do. In fact, businesses have to account for myriad data-privacy regulations when developing and deploying enterprise blockchain solutions.With a plethora of international and United States-specific privacy laws, data privacy and security are becoming more structured. Notably, Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation was implemented in 2016 and was the first comprehensive legislation aimed at protecting individual privacy and preventing companies from misusing customer data. In the U.S., the California Consumer Privacy Act soon followed, preceding a wave of similar (but different) regulatory mandates introduced across the country. About half of U.S. states are actively working toward privacy legislation of their own, with states such as Virginia, Colorado and Utah formally introducing regulations.Related: 4 Essentials for Complying With the New Data Privacy RegulationsAlthough many of these statutes are anchored by the same core principles of protecting consumers\u2019 data, there\u2019s enough variance to give corporate compliance teams headaches -- and plenty of reason to break out the proverbial red tape at the first mention of enterprise blockchain.Even so, the potential uses of blockchain technology are too appealing for companies to remain on the sidelines for long. Rather than preventing enterprise blockchain adoption, the hodgepodge of data legislation making its way through state courts today will likely influence key decisions around solution architectures as application development picks up.These new regulations impact many advanced technologies. However, there are inherent differences in the way data is secured and distributed across a blockchain network -- when compared to cloud networks or local area networks, for example -- that are both good and bad for businesses.As a shared distributed ledger technology where transactions are appended as blocks across many connected computers, blockchain eliminates the need for centralized oversight and data storage. That means blockchain deployments provide a confidence framework where tighter integrations, process automation via smart contracts, and unprecedented privacy controls enable the creation of entirely new business models. On the other hand, the same mechanisms that make the technology so revolutionary also create an additional layer of complexity for architects, designers, and compliance teams.Related: The Scalability Conundrum of Blockchain NetworksBig decisions aheadIn regulated industries, the participants that comprise a blockchain network must be identified and known. The architecture of an enterprise blockchain application -- specifically the processes for onboarding those participants, managing keys, and other credentials that enable participation, and determining the distribution of nodes (computers that power the network) -- must account for the relevant regulatory requirements in each jurisdiction the network touches. That network could easily include jurisdictions scattered around the globe.If, for instance, you\u2019re working on a blockchain that crosses national borders and encompasses machines in countries that have varying mandates governing the use of certain data, you\u2019d probably face some uncertainty as to how to proceed. Should you sacrifice elements of security or efficacy to avoid countries that have ambiguous or unfavorable laws? Or should you hire a third party with both the legal expertise and technical acumen to make alternative recommendations? What if one country enacts legislation prohibiting the transfer of personally identifiable information across borders?So far, these questions don\u2019t have hard-and-fast answers. Architects and designers have to work carefully to ensure data is stored appropriately and to define what data is essential to the network early in the development life cycle of any enterprise blockchain application. They\u2019ll also have to make sound decisions to ensure adherence to regulations, eliminate rework and streamline the delivery of value to network participants.That\u2019s no easy ask. Because blockchains are distributed by design (and often cross borders), architects will be in a constant quest for balance. They\u2019ll need to make sure the network meets all applicable regulations. At the same time, they\u2019ll need to ensure that there\u2019s enough information in the blockchain to establish data authenticity, therefore maintaining trust within the ecosystem.Searching for clarityIf companies want to succeed with blockchain or any other digital transformation initiatives, they must have a strategy that ensures data and privacy regulations are a priority consideration rather than an afterthought. Above all, that means sticking to the following best practices:1. Use the most stringent requirements as a baselineA solution that adheres to the most austere regulatory standards found in the myriad data and privacy statutes will be the best solution in the long run. Given the relative maturity and comprehensive nature of the General Data Protection Regulation, you might start your compliance journey there. Disney has strong privacy guidelines and communicates compliance to customers. In fact, GDPR is one of the main reasons Disney was initially slow to announce its rollout of Disney+ in the U.K. Disney had to fully understand the local privacy regulations to ensure its underlying systems adhered to these stringent standards.2. Make data and privacy an organizational imperativeData and privacy will continue to be defining political topics in the digital age, and related laws will only become more numerous. Companies should continually educate business and technology teams on the importance of data protection and see that architectural assessments explicitly include data privacy and protection as a gate for approval. For large organizations, it might even make sense to create or assign an executive role tasked with overseeing privacy and protection across the company, and with an understanding of how emerging legislation might shape future strategy.Related: Regulation Is Coming to the Crypto Business3. Expect continuous maintenanceContinuous maintenance is the nature of all technology solutions and therefore needs to be planned in from the beginning. Regulatory requirements related to blockchain and other new technologies are constantly evolving, and that means your internal policies governing the use of this tech should be evolving. Moreover, whenever technology is playing a key role in data privacy and protection (which is almost always), make sure that tools and platforms are scalable and adaptable so that you don\u2019t have to invest in new ones every time regulatory language changes. Having a scalable platform and robust set of tools enables companies to more quickly adapt to regulations without having to put a product roadmap in jeopardy due to the regulatory environment.4. Create a recovery planEven with the most carefully constructed plans, data leakage is inevitable at some point. That\u2019s why every company should have guardrails in place for when data escapes your network. Create a remediation plan that\u2019s not only well-defined, but also easy for key stakeholders to access just in case. TiVo relies on data to provide advanced recommendations and leverage search engines, requiring scalable infrastructure that dynamically adapts to the on-demand nature of streaming services and cable television. A key part of dynamic scaling includes having a recovery plan that is part of the scaling infrastructure that leverages both traditional backup and recovery techniques combined with heuristics that predict scaling needs. Together, they provide a dynamic, scalable, and dependable service that meets the high demands of their customers.Privacy regulations won\u2019t necessarily slow the adoption of blockchain, but they will have an impact on key decisions around the architecture of a blockchain solution. With the digital landscape, data privacy regulations in one corner of the world will impact digital practices in another. Business leaders must develop solutions that ensure data and privacy regulations are part of business decisions as a priority -- not an afterthought.\n7 Stocks to Buy That Will Benefit From InflationThere are two narratives that are getting conflated when it comes to inflation. The first is whether or not inflation is occurring. And the second is whether inflation will get out of control.\n\nTo the first point, the clear answer is absolutely. There are price increases in everything from commodities to semiconductor chips. And even though lumber prices have gone down it\u2019s a good bet that many consumers will put off their deck projects for another day.\n\nAnd, of course, inflation numbers tend to strip out gas and groceries \u2013 but those are precisely the areas where consumers feel inflation the most. Inflation is real.\n\nBut is this just \u201ctransitory\u201d as many analysts and the Fed itself claim? Or is it only the beginning of something much worse? The answer to those questions is probably above our pay grade.\n\nAs an investor, the inflation narrative only changes where you allocate your investment dollars. And for the most part, you\u2019re probably only looking at a small percentage of your portfolio.\n\nHowever, the first rule of investing is to not lose money so it\u2019s important to identify companies that can provide a hedge against inflation \u2013 transitory or otherwise.\n\nThat\u2019s the focus of this special presentation. Right now there are many strong companies that benefit when inflation is on the rise.\nView the \"7 Stocks to Buy That Will Benefit From Inflation\"."

(Ludovic Marin/Pool photo via AP, File)\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 France announced multibillion-euro deals Friday to sell fighter planes and combat helicopters to the United Arab Emirates, aiming to boost military cooperation with its top ally in the Persian Gulf amid their shared concerns about Iran.\nThe UAE is buying 80 upgraded Rafale warplanes in a deal the French Defense Ministry said is worth 16 billion euros ($18 billion) and represents the largest-ever French weapons contract for export. It also announced a deal with the UAE to sell 12 Airbus-built combat helicopters.\nThey offer a shot in the arm for France\u2019s defense industry after the collapse of a $66 billion contract for Australia to buy 12 French submarines that ultimately went to the U.S. But the deals faced criticism by human rights groups concerned about the track record of the Gulf country and its allies in the region.\nThe UAE contracts were signed as French President Emmanuel Macron visited the country on the first stop of a two-day visit to the Persian Gulf. France and Gulf countries have long been concerned by Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions and influence across the region, particularly in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. \nFrance has particularly deep ties to the UAE, a federation of seven sheikdoms on the Arabian Peninsula. France has a naval base there and French warplanes and personnel also are stationed in a major facility outside the Emirati capital, Abu Dhabi.\nThe French Defense Ministry, in its statement announcing the helicopter deal, said the two countries share the objective of using \u201csimilar defense equipment\u201d so they can work more closely together and \u201cpromote operational cooperation between our two armed forces.\u201d \nEmirati officials confirmed the contracts. Manufacturer Dassault Aviation said the UAE is buying the upgraded F4 version of its multirole Rafale combat aircraft. That will make the Emirates Air Force the first Rafale F4 user outside of France, it said.\nDassault Aviation boss Eric Trappier called the sale \u201ca French success story\" and \u201cexcellent news for France and for its aeronautical industry.\u201d \nThe purchase marks a sizable step up for the UAE's military capabilities in the oil- and gas-rich region. Charles Forrester, a senior analyst at Janes, said the fighter \u201cwill significantly upgrade UAE\u2019s airpower capabilities in terms of strike, air-to-air warfare, and reconnaissance.\" \nDassault said the Rafale will give the UAE \u201ca tool capable of guaranteeing sovereignty and operational independence\u201d and that it will start delivering the planes in 2027.\nMacron and Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, were present at the Rafale contract signing.\nFrench defense officials were jubilant. Defense Minister Florence Parly said the Rafale deal \u201cdirectly contributes to regional stability.\u201d The additional sale of Caracal helicopters also illustrates \u201cthe density of our defense relationship,\u201d she said. \nHuman rights groups said weapons the UAE provides to its Gulf allies could be used \u201cfor unlawful attacks or even war crimes\u201d in Yemen and Libya, the two conflicts that the UAE has been accused of being involved in through proxies.\n\u201cFrance\u2019s support for the UAE and Saudi Arabia is even more objectional as their leaders have failed to improve their countries\u2019 disastrous human rights records domestically, although their public relations efforts to present themselves as progressive and tolerant internationally is in full swing,\u201d Human Rights Watch said in a statement ahead of Macron\u2019s trip to the Gulf.\nMacron\u2019s keen interest in forging personal relationships with Abu Dhabi's crown prince and his counterpart in Saudi Arabia, Mohamed bin Salman Al Saud, makes him a welcome guest in the region. Both Gulf leaders value a degree of pragmatism when discussing democracy and human rights \u2014 issues on which their countries have been heavy criticized by rights groups and European lawmakers \u2014 while pursuing business opportunities. \nMonths after Macron was elected in 2017, he traveled to the UAE to inaugurate Louvre Abu Dhabi, built under a $1.2 billion agreement to share the name and art of the world-famous museum in Paris. \nIn September, Macron hosted Abu Dhabi's crown prince at the historic Chateau de Fontainebleau outside Paris, which was restored in 2019 with a UAE donation of 10 million euros ($11.3 million). \nThe UAE and France also have become increasingly aligned over a shared mistrust of Islamist political parties across the Middle East and backed the same side in Libya's civil strife.\nA senior French presidency official who spoke to reporters ahead of the trip on customary condition of anonymity said Macron will \u201ccontinue to push and support the efforts that contribute to the stability of the region, from the Mediterranean to the Gulf.\u201d\nGulf tensions will be discussed, the official said, in particular the revived talks about Iran\u2019s nuclear deal with world powers, following then-U.S. President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the agreement. \n\u201cThis is a hot topic,\u201d the French official said, adding that Macron discussed the issues in a phone call Monday with Iran's president. He will talk about the call and the issues \u2014 including the nuclear deal talks in Vienna \u2014 with Gulf leaders, who are \u201cdirectly concerned by this subject, like all of us but also because they are (Iran\u2019s) neighbors,\u201d the official said. \nFrance, along with Germany and the United Kingdom, thinks the 2015 nuclear agreement \u2014 with minor tweaks \u2014 is the way forward with Iran, analysts say. The UAE and Saudi Arabia have bitterly opposed the West\u2019s negotiated deal with Iran. \n\u201cAlthough the Gulf countries did not like the West\u2019s deal with Iran, the prospect of it falling apart acrimoniously is also bad for them and arguably presents worse risks,\u201d said Jane Kinninmont, a London-based Gulf expert with the European Leadership Network think tank. \n\u201cTheir view has always been the West should have gotten more out of Iran before sealing the deal,\u201d Kinninmont said. \u201cBut if the West walks away with nothing, the Gulf countries are beginning to understand that their security will not improve as a result.\u201d \n___\nSurk reported from Nice, France.

The first is whether or not inflation is occurring. And the second is whether inflation will get out of control.\n\nTo the first point, the clear answer is absolutely. There are price increases in everything from commodities to semiconductor chips. And even though lumber prices have gone down it\u2019s a good bet that many consumers will put off their deck projects for another day.\n\nAnd, of course, inflation numbers tend to strip out gas and groceries \u2013 but those are precisely the areas where consumers feel inflation the most. Inflation is real.\n\nBut is this just \u201ctransitory\u201d as many analysts and the Fed itself claim? Or is it only the beginning of something much worse? The answer to those questions is probably above our pay grade.\n\nAs an investor, the inflation narrative only changes where you allocate your investment dollars. And for the most part, you\u2019re probably only looking at a small percentage of your portfolio.\n\nHowever, the first rule of investing is to not lose money so it\u2019s important to identify companies that can provide a hedge against inflation \u2013 transitory or otherwise.\n\nThat\u2019s the focus of this special presentation. Right now there are many strong companies that benefit when inflation is on the rise.\nView the \"7 Stocks to Buy That Will Benefit From Inflation\"."

        "Article": "COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) \u2014 A U.N expert says contemporary forms of slavery exist in Sri Lanka, with vulnerable groups such as children, women, ethnic minorities and older people particularly affected.\nTomoyo Obokata, the U.N special rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, said Friday at the end of a mission to Sri Lanka that he hopes to submit a report to the U.N. Human Rights Council in September next year.\nObokata said about 1% of Sri Lankan children are involved in some type of child labor, most of it considered hazardous.\n\u201cGirls and boys work in the domestic sector, in hospitality, cleaning in the general service industry. Others are sexually exploited in the tourism sector,\" he said.\nChild labor is particularly severe in areas populated by ethnic minority Tamils, such as in tea and rubber planation regions where children are forced to drop out of school and support their families, he said.\nThe office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights says contemporary forms of slavery include traditional slavery, forced labor, debt bondage, serfdom, children working in slavery or slavery-like conditions, domestic servitude, sexual slavery and servile forms of marriage.\n\u201cI witnessed that in Sri Lanka contemporary forms of slavery have an ethnic dimension,\" Obokata said. \u201cIn particular, Malayaha Tamils, who were brought from India to work in the plantation sector 200 years ago, continue to face multiple forms of discrimination based on their origin.\u201d\nHe said the planation Tamils' inability to own land has forced them to live in \u201cline houses\u201d built during colonial times. \n\"I was frankly very much distressed by the way they are living. Five to 10 people stuffed in tiny spaces. No proper kitchen or toilet or shower facilities, just appalling conditions. I have recommended to the government to do something about this because frankly I was distraught myself,\u201d Obokata said.\nGovernment officials were not immediately available for comment.\nWomen and girls are disproportionately affected by contemporary forms of slavery, with females predominantly filling jobs in demanding sectors such as plantation, garment industry and domestic labor, he said.\nIn the plantation sector, women must meet daily targets to earn the minimum daily wage, Obokata said.\n\u201cSimilarly, increasingly high targets in the garment sector put continuous pressure on the female workers. As a consequence, some even choose not to go to the bathroom in order to meet the targets,\" he said.\nIn some cases, such as in the planation sector, older workers are compelled to regularly perform physically challenging work because younger people choose to be employed outside the sector. They have no access to adequate health care, social protection, or paid sick leave, he said.7 Stocks That are Ready For a Santa Claus RallyWith the end of the year approaching, many investors are looking to rebalance their portfolios. That typically means casting a critical eye at some of your strong performers and making a decision on whether they will move higher. And one thing that can dip the balance in favor of retaining a stock is the likelihood of a Santa Claus rally.\n\nThe technical definition of a Santa Claus rally is a rally that starts in the last few trading days of the year after the Christmas holiday. In recent years, however, that definition has been expanded to take into account a December rally. And with Black Friday beginning earlier and earlier and really not ending until after the holiday's end, this makes some sense.\n\nSo will there be a rally in 2021? I wouldn\u2019t bet against it. The market continues to want to move higher and January is historically a strong month for stocks. With that said, we believe quality should still matter. Here are seven stocks that stand to benefit with or without a Santa Claus rally.View the \"7 Stocks That are Ready For a Santa Claus Rally\"."

And it has been a catalyst for the gamification of stock trading. However, there was one prediction that looked like a good bet then and does even more so now. That prediction was that Americans would begin to travel en masse as soon as they possibly could.\n\nWhile America may not be back to a pre-pandemic normal, it\u2019s much closer than it was just six months ago. And Americans are making investors in travel stocks very happy.\n\nBut is this a case of the easy gains being gone? Should investors be concerned about the Delta variant of the novel coronavirus that is causing public health restrictions to be enacted in certain areas of the world?\n\nAt this point, neither of those statements seems to be true. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve put together this special presentation that focuses on travel stocks. We\u2019ve looked at different sectors of the travel category and selected a sample of companies whose stocks look like good investments for the rest of 2021 and likely beyond.\nView the \"7 Travel Stocks to Buy as Summer Kicks Into High Gear\"."

(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert)\nRESERVE, La. (AP) \u2014 Michael Coleman's house is the last one standing on his tiny street, squeezed between a sprawling oil refinery whose sounds and smells keep him up at night and a massive grain elevator that covers his pickup in dust and, he says, exacerbates his breathing problems.\nColeman, 65, points to the billowing smokestacks just outside his backyard. \u201cOh, when the plants came in, they built right on top of us,\" he said. \u201cWe was surrounded by sugarcane, and now we\u2019re surrounded by (industrial) plants.\u201d\nThe oil company offered Coleman a buyout, but he rejected it. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for a fair shake,\" he said in an interview on the front steps of the home he has lived in for more than 50 years. In the meantime, he copes with high blood pressure, thyroid problems and other health issues that he attributes to decades of pollution from his industrial neighbors, a Marathon Petroleum refinery and a Cargill grain depot.\nSt. John the Baptist Parish, where Coleman lives, is part of an 85-mile (137-kilometer) stretch from New Orleans to Baton Rouge officially known as the Mississippi River Chemical Corridor, but more commonly called Cancer Alley. The region contains several hotspots where cancer risks are far above levels deemed acceptable by the Environmental Protection Agency.\nEPA Administrator Michael Regan visited Coleman and other area residents on a five-day \u201cJourney to Justice\u201d tour that highlighted low-income, mostly minority communities adversely affected by decades of industrial pollution. \nA Toxics Release Inventory prepared by EPA shows that minority groups make up 56% of those living near toxic sites such as refineries, landfills and chemical plants. Negative effects include chronic health problems such as asthma, diabetes and hypertension. \n\u201cI\u2019m able to put faces and names with this term that we call environmental justice,\" Regan said at a news conference outside Coleman\u2019s ramshackle home, where a blue tarp covers roof damage from Hurricane Ida.\n\u201cThis what we are talking about when we talk about \u2018fence-line communities\u2019 \u2014 those communities who have been disproportionately impacted by pollution and are having to live in these conditions,\" Regan said, gesturing to the grain elevator in front of him and refinery behind. \nIn nearby St. James, Regan met with Brenda Bryant, whose neighborhood is surrounded by oil storage tanks and a hulking refinery.\n\u201cWe are actually sandwiched in. And I\u2019m the meat,\" Bryant told Regan, who assured her that she and others he met with \u201cwill have a seat at the table\" as officials develop solutions for long-ignored communities.\nA former environmental regulator in his native North Carolina, Regan has made environmental justice a top priority since taking over as EPA head in March. As the first Black man to lead the agency, the issue \"is really personal for me, as well as professional,'' Regan said in an interview.\n\u201cAs I look at many of the folks in these communities, they look just like me. They look just like my son, and it\u2019s really tough to see them question the quality of their drinking water,'' he said.\nHistorically marginalized communities like St. John and St. James, along with cities such as New Orleans, Jackson, Mississippi, and Houston will benefit from the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law signed by President Joe Biden, Regan said. The law includes $55 billion for water and wastewater infrastructure, while a sweeping climate and social policy bill pending in the Senate would pump more than twice that amount into EPA programs to clean up the environment and address water and environmental justice issues.\nWhile legislation can help, Regan acknowledged that decades of neglect and widespread health problems among mostly Black and Brown communities won\u2019t be solved overnight. Loose permitting requirements for industrial sites, along with exclusionary zoning laws and housing practices, have long funneled racial and ethnic minorities into areas near toxic pollutants at rates far higher than the overall population.\nAt a congressional hearing in October, oil company executives sidestepped questions about whether refineries and other facilities are more likely to be located in low-income and minority communities.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got oil refineries along the U.S. Gulf Coast, and we\u2019re very proud to be community members there,\" Shell Oil President Gretchen Watkins told Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo.\n\u201cYour profit-driven choices threaten my life, the lives of my family, my neighbors, and our communities every single day,\" Bush responded.\nIn Louisiana, a recent inspector general\u2019s report faulted EPA for failing to protect St. John, St. James and other parishes from chloroprene and ethylene oxide, toxic chemicals used in industrial processes.\n\u201cIf EPA, the federal government, the state government, the local governments had been doing things correctly, we wouldn\u2019t be here,\u2033 Regan said in St. John. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously a problem with the way we have implemented our laws. And quite frankly, there may be a problem with existing law.\"\nEnvironmental injustice is not limited to the South, and Regan has also visited hard-hit areas in cities such as Chicago, Detroit and Los Angeles, as well as brownfields and tribal areas in North Dakota.\n\u201cFor the first time we\u2019re not questioning whether or not these environmental injustices exist,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are actually acknowledging that they do. We need to give these individuals a voice and talk about what we\u2019re going to do to solve these problems moving forward.''\nMore immediately, Regan promised that EPA will use its enforcement power to ensure a former DuPont petrochemical plant near Coleman\u2019s home complies with federal regulations on emissions of chloroprene and other harmful chemicals. The facility is now owned by Japanese conglomerate Denka.\n\u201cWe have enforcement authority that we\u2019re taking a very close look at to bring the facility in compliance \u2014 not just this facility, but all the facilities across the country who have been non-compliant, who have not honored the agreements that we have to be good neighbors and protect these communities,\" he told residents in St. John. \n\u201cThe message here to these communities is, we have to do better and we will do better,\" Regan said.\nSCHOOL WITHOUT WATER\nRegan's first stop on the tour was at Wilkins Elementary School in Jackson, Mississippi, where students are forced to use portable restrooms outside the building because low water pressure from the city\u2019s crumbling infrastructure makes school toilets virtually unusable.\nThe pressure was so low on the day Regan visited that the school was closed. The next day, more than a dozen Jackson schools were closed because of a lack of water.\nAs the father of an 8-year-old, \u201cmy heart was broken today,\" Regan told The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating to see the disruptions they face.\"\nFourth-graders brought to the school to meet with Regan spoke of their own frustrations. Kingston Lewis, 9, said he doesn\u2019t like going outside to use the restroom in a mobile trailer.\n\u201cIt takes a lot of learning time throughout our day, and it has an unpleasant scent sometimes when you go outside,\" he told Regan.\nPrincipal Cheryl Brown called the school\u2019s dependence on portable toilets \u201cdegrading\u201d and \u201cinhuman at all levels.\" Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba called the water outages \u201da cycle of humiliation within our community\u201d and an example of \u201cwhat it looks like for our children when we fail to provide.\"\nLumumba said in an interview that his impoverished city needs about $2 billion to fix its water infrastructure, but expects to receive far less from the infrastructure law and other federal spending. The majority Black city often \u201cfails to get its equitable share of resources that funnel through the state\u201d and its Republican governor and GOP-controlled legislature, he said.\nAMERICAN DREAM OR \u2018NIGHTMARE\u2019?\nRegan also visited Gordon Plaza, a New Orleans neighborhood built on the site of a former toxic landfill, and the creosote-contaminated Kashmere Gardens neighborhood in Houston. Gordon Plaza was designated as a Superfund site in the 1990s, but dozens of mostly Black families still live there, waiting for a buyout, and many feel forgotten.\nA 2019 report by Louisiana State University found that the city\u2019s Desire section, which includes Gordon Plaza, had the second-highest cancer rate in the state.\nDuring a walking tour, neighborhood residents gave Regan a T-shirt as they urged him to remember their community\u2019s name. They cheered when he said the words \u201cGordon Plaza\u201d had reached the White House. \u201cYou have my commitment that the EPA will partner with you all to solve this problem,\u201d he said.\nNew Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell has pledged $35 million for Gordon Plaza, but residents have heard promises before.\n\u201cYou\u2019re trying to live out the American Dream \u2014 which turns out to be a nightmare \u2014 and you can\u2019t get justice, you know,\u201d said resident Earl Smothers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s environmental racism,\u2033 resident Lydwina Hurst told Regan. Still, Hurst said she appreciated Regan\u2019s visit and is hopeful residents will finally get the help they need.\nBeverly Wright, executive director of the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice, a New Orleans-based group that hosted Regan at several Louisiana sites, said the problems Regan witnessed are \u201cgenerational battles\" with no easy solution.\nStill, she\u2019s optimistic that \u201cthe wheels are aligning\u201d to finally address problems that have festered locally for decades.\n\u201cI think putting a face and a name on these problems makes it personal,\" Wright said. \u201cWhen you can taste the chemicals in your mouth and smell the toxins downwind, it\u2019s a lot more difficult to ignore.\"Should you invest $1,000 in DuPont de Nemours right now?Before you consider DuPont de Nemours, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

(Chinatopix via AP)\nBEIJING (AP) \u2014 After a blessing by Buddhist monks, Lao Prime Minister Phankham Viphavanh on Friday rode the first run of a $5.9 billion Chinese-built railway that links isolated, mountainous Laos with southern China in an effort to increase trade.\nBoth governments tout the 1,035-kilometer (642-mile) line from the Lao capital, Vientiane to Kunming in China\u2019s poor southwest as a boost to economic growth. But it leaves a debt that foreign experts warn Laos, a country of 7 million people wedged between China, Vietnam and Thailand, might struggle to repay.\nThe railway is one of hundreds of projects under Beijing\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative to build ports, railways and other facilities across Asia, Africa and the Pacific. Poor countries welcome the initiative, but some complain they are left owing too much to Chinese banks.\nThe first train pulled out of Vientiane following an inauguration ceremony conducted by Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Lao counterpart, Thongloun Sisoulith, over a video link from their capitals, the Lao news agency reported.\nOn Thursday, saffron-robed Lao monks conducted a ceremony for the railway, according to the Lao news agency.\nThe railway is to carry only cargo across the border for now due to curbs on passenger travel imposed to contain the coronavirus.\nThe Kunming-Vientiane railway is a link in a possible future network connecting China with Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar, Malaysia and Singapore. That would give southern China more access to ports and export markets.\nChinese contractors are building a high-speed rail line from the Thai capital, Bangkok, to the Lao border. That won\u2019t be completed until 2028 and will leave a gap between the border and the line to China.\nBorrowed money makes up 60% of the railway\u2019s investment. Foreign experts say that is unusually high for an infrastructure project and increases the risk that the railway might fail to generate enough revenue to repay its debt.\nLaos has been one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies over the past decade but still is among the poorest. Its average economic output per person more than doubled since 2010 but stands at $2,600.7 Trucking Stocks That Are About to Go On a RollAmericans are facing a historic supply chain crisis.

(Ludovic Marin/Pool photo via AP, File)\nNICE, France (AP) \u2014 France announced the signing Friday of a 16 billion-euro ($18 billion) armaments mega-contract for the sale of 80 of its Rafale warplanes to the United Arab Emirates.\nThe French Defense Ministry said the deal was France\u2019s largest-ever weapons contract for export. It came as French President Emmanuel Macron is in the Emirates on the first stop of a two-day visit to the Persian Gulf. There was no immediate confirmation of the deal from Emirati officials.\nManufacturer Dassault Aviation said the UAE is buying the upgraded F4 version of its multi-role combat aircraft. That will make the Emirates Air Force the first user outside of France of the Rafale F4, it said.\nThe deal offers a shot in the arm for France's defense industry after the collapse of a $66 billion contract for Australia to buy 12 French submarines. \nDassault Aviation boss Eric Trappier called the sale \u201ca French success story\" and \u201cexcellent news for France and for its aeronautical industry.\u201d \nMacron\u2019s keen interest in forging personal relationships with leaders like Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, and his counterpart in Saudi Arabia, Mohamed bin Salman Al Saud, makes him a welcome guest in the region. Both Gulf leaders value a degree of pragmatism when discussing democracy and human rights \u2014 issues on which their countries have been heavy criticized by rights groups and European lawmakers \u2014 while pursuing business opportunities. \nFrance has deep ties to the United Arab Emirates, a federation of seven sheikdoms on the Arabian Peninsula, particularly since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The UAE opened a French naval base in 2009 at Abu Dhabi\u2019s Port Zayed. French warplanes and personnel are also stationed at Al-Dhafra Air Base, a major facility outside the Emirati capital of Abu Dhabi that\u2019s also home to several thousand American troops. \nMonths after Macron was elected in 2017, he traveled to the UAE to inaugurate Louvre Abu Dhabi, built under a $1.2 billion agreement to share the name and art of the world-famous museum in Paris. \nIn September, Macron hosted Abu Dhabi's crown prince at the historic Chateau de Fontainebleau outside Paris, which was restored in 2019 with a UAE donation of 10 million euros ($11.3 million). \nThe UAE and France have also become increasingly aligned over a shared mistrust of Islamist political parties across the Middle East, and backed the same side in Libya's civil strife.\nA senior French presidency official who spoke to reporters ahead of the trip on customary condition of anonymity said Macron will \u201ccontinue to push and support the efforts that contribute to the stability of the region, from the Mediterranean to the Gulf.\u201d\nGulf tensions will be discussed, the official said, in particular the revived talks about Iran\u2019s nuclear deal with world powers, following the U.S. withdrawal from the agreement by President Donald Trump. Gulf countries have long been concerned by Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions and influence across the region, particularly in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. \n\u201cThis is a hot topic,\u201d the French official said, adding that Macron discussed the issues in a phone call Monday with Iran's president. He will talk about the call and the issues \u2014 including the nuclear deal talks in Vienna \u2014 with Gulf leaders, who are \u201cdirectly concerned by this subject, like all of us but also because they are (Iran\u2019s) neighbors,\u201d the official said. \nFrance, along with Germany and the U.K., thinks the 2015 nuclear agreement \u2014 with minor tweaks \u2014 is the way forward with Iran, analysts say. The UAE and Saudi Arabia have bitterly opposed the West\u2019s negotiated deal with Iran. \n\u201cAlthough the Gulf countries did not like the West\u2019s deal with Iran, the prospect of it falling apart acrimoniously is also bad for them and arguably presents worse risks,\u201d said Jane Kinninmont, a London-based Gulf expert with the European Leadership Network think-tank. \n\u201cTheir view has always been the West should have gotten more out of Iran before sealing the deal,\u201d Kinninmont said. \u201cBut if the West walks away with nothing, the Gulf countries are beginning to understand that their security will not improve as a result.\u201d 7 Undervalued Stocks in an Overvalued MarketIn June 2021 the investment firm, Bespoke Investments made this ominous pronouncement: \u201cInvestors simultaneously think the market is overvalued, but likely to keep climbing.\u201d\n\nThis statement was meant to be a warning to investors. However, investors have shown that they can be very resilient even as the major indices continue to reach new highs.\n\nSo it would seem strange to be looking at a list of undervalued stocks. But looking at undervalued stocks is a form of value investing. And in 2021, investors are shifting between growth and value investing on a monthly, if not weekly basis.\n\nAn undervalued stock is one that is considered to be trading below its fair value. However, there\u2019s no singular right way to identify undervalued stocks. Some investors prefer to look at fundamental metrics. Others will look for technical signals.\n\nThe one common element of all undervalued stocks is that they are stocks that have room to grow. That\u2019s something that all investors can get behind. And in this special presentation, we\u2019ll take a look at seven stocks that are showing signs of being undervalued at this time.\nView the \"7 Undervalued Stocks in an Overvalued Market\"."

Part of that framework will be a $12,500 tax credit for electric vehicle purchases. That increases the current subsidy by $4,500. And it\u2019s music to the ears of EV companies in the United States who are making plans to scale production.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean the country is close to having an EV in every driveway. There is still the issue of a charging infrastructure. The chip shortage will be a headwind on auto production of all types for at least the next several quarters. And many EV companies are not even on the starting blocks yet.\n\nBut It does mean that momentum is building. And for investors who retreated to the sideline after the EV bubble burst in early 2021, it may be time to get back in the game.\n\nIn this special presentation, we\u2019re looking at seven stocks that stand to benefit from these subsidies in the United States.

(AP Andrew Harnik, File)\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Chinese companies will have to disclose more information about audits and whether they are controlled by a government or else leave U.S. stock markets under a rule approved by securities regulators.\nThe rule approved Thursday by the Securities and Exchange Commission steps up a long-running standoff between Washington and Beijing over how much information companies with U.S.-traded shares must disclosed.\nCompanies that used an auditor in a foreign jurisdiction will be required to confirm they are not \u201cowned or controlled by a government entity\u201d there, according to the SEC. Companies also will be required to disclose additional information in annual reports.\n\u201cTrading prohibitions\u201d can be imposed on some companies, the SEC said.\nOther governments cooperate with U.S. demands for more financial details from companies to prevent false reporting. But Beijing, citing security concerns, refuses to allow the U.S. Public Companies Accounting Oversight Board to review work of Chinese auditors.\nChina's government criticized the move and warned it might block American investors from access to fast-growing companies.\nThe measure is an attempt to \u201cpolitically suppress Chinese companies\u201d and \u201ccontain China\u2019s development,\u201d said a foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian.\n\u201cWe are firmly opposed to that,\u201d Zhao said.\nHundreds of Chinese companies have raised tens of billions of dollars in U.S. financial markets, but their status is a matter of growing dispute with Beijing.\nThe latest rule applies to audit firms the PCAOB is \u201cunable to inspect or investigate,\u201d the SEC said, a group that would be mostly Chinese.\nSeparately, the U.S. government earlier barred Americans from investing in the stocks, bonds and other securities of Chinese companies deemed to be linked to the ruling Communist Party\u2019s efforts to upgrade its military technology.7 Social Media Stocks That Are Worth Your AttentionIf you have a child in high school, they likely will not know a world that didn\u2019t include social media. And for better or worse, social media is here to stay. That\u2019s because these companies have developed ways to keep their users engaged. And engagement is the keyword.\n\nFor the most part, social media companies generate money through ad revenue. Simply put, the more active (i.e. engaged) users they have, the more revenue they generate.\n\nHigher revenue leads to earnings growth. And earnings growth is always a harbinger of a higher stock price. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important for investors to pay attention to this sector even if they\u2019re not active users of social media themselves.\n\nFor the purposes of this presentation, we\u2019re not including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). The company is well known as the leading social media stock. However, the company\u2019s recent troubles are also well documented. And as of this writing, FB stock remains under pressure. It may, and likely will become a buy and perhaps at a better valuation. But for now, Facebook doesn\u2019t get a like.\n\nBut if you\u2019re interested in which social media stocks may be good buys, we\u2019re happy to give you \u201c7 Social Media Stocks That Are Worth Your Attention\u201dView the \"7 Social Media Stocks That Are Worth Your Attention\"."

Inflation is going to be an unwelcome guest at our holiday gatherings this year. Estimates say this will be the most expensive Thanksgiving dinner in years. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) jumped 6.2% in October. That was the biggest surge in 30 years.\n\nBut the latest inflation data only confirmed what investors already knew. At least the ones that put gas in their cars or buy groceries. And yet, Washington continues to advocate even more spending. The latest \u201cskinny\u201d infrastructure bill will still pump over $1 trillion (that\u2019s trillion with a \u201cT\u201d) into the economy. Even economists who would usually be favorably disposed to the current administration acknowledge that this will only cause inflation to increase.\n\nThat means it\u2019s a good time to consider investing in precious metals which are considered to be safe-haven assets and a hedge against inflation. But that\u2019s not the only reason to consider precious metals. You can also get some nice growth. Gold, for example, is up more than 300% in the past 15 years. And we would certainly advocate that you consider owning a bit of physical metals if you can.\n\nHowever, buying precious metals stocks gives you exposure to many mining companies. As the spot price for the metals rises, it becomes more profitable for these companies to run their mining operations.\nView the \"7 Precious Metals Stocks That Will Offset the Effects of Inflation\"."

A quick passage of the measure in the Senate has been in doubt because of a fight over President Joe Biden's COVID-19 vaccine mandates. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Senate has passed a stopgap spending bill that avoids a short-term shutdown and funds the federal government through Feb. 18 after leaders defused a partisan standoff over federal vaccine mandates. The measure now goes to President Joe Biden to be signed into law.\nEarlier Thursday, congressional leaders announced they had finally reached an agreement to keep the government running for 11 more weeks, generally at current spending levels, while adding $7 billion to aid Afghanistan evacuees.\nOnce the House voted to approve the measure, senators soon announced an agreement that would allow them to vote on it quickly.\n\u201cI am glad that in the end, cooler heads prevailed. The government will stay open and I thank the members of this chamber for walking us back from the brink of an avoidable, needless and costly shutdown,\" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.\nThe Senate approved the measure by a vote of 69-28.\nThe Democratic-led House passed the measure by a 221-212 vote. The Republican leadership urged members to vote no; the lone GOP vote for the bill came from Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger.\nLawmakers bemoaned the short-term fix and blamed the opposing party for the lack of progress on this year's spending bills. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, chair of the House Appropriations Committee, said the measure would, however, allow for negotiations on a package covering the full budget year through September.\n\u201cMake no mistake, a vote against this continuing resolution is a vote to shut government down,\" DeLauro said during the House debate.\nBefore the votes, Biden said he had spoken with Senate leaders and he played down fears of a shutdown.\n\u201cThere is a plan in place unless somebody decides to be totally erratic, and I don\u2019t think that will happen,\" Biden said.\nSome Republicans opposed to Biden\u2019s vaccine rules wanted Congress to take a hard stand against the mandated shots for workers at larger businesses, even if that meant shutting down federal offices over the weekend by blocking a request that would expedite a final vote on the spending bill. \nIt was just the latest instance of the brinkmanship around government funding that has triggered several costly shutdowns and partial closures over the past two decades. The longest shutdown in history happened under President Donald Trump \u2014 35 days stretching into January 2019, when Democrats refused to approve money for his U.S-Mexico border wall. Both parties agree the stoppages are irresponsible, yet few deadlines pass without a late scramble to avoid them.\nSen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said Democrats knew last month that several Republicans would use all means at their disposal to oppose legislation that funds or allows the enforcement of the employer vaccine mandate. He blamed Schumer for not negotiating and for ignoring their position.\nIf the choice is between \u201csuspending nonessential functions\u201d or standing idle while Americans lose their ability to work, \u201cI\u2019ll stand with American workers every time,\u201d Lee said.\nLee and Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., authored an amendment that prohibited federal dollars being spent to implement and enforce a series of vaccine mandates put in place by the Biden administration. The amendment went down to defeat with 48 yes votes and 50 no votes. But having the vote opened the door to taking up the full spending bill immediately.\nLee said millions were being forced to choose between an unwanted medical procedure and losing their job. \n\u201cTheir jobs are being threatened by their own government,\" Lee said.\n\u201cLet's give employers certainty and employees peace of mind that they will still have a job this new year,\" Marshall urged before the vote.\nSen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., countered that the federal government should be using every tool to keep Americans safe and that is why the Biden administration has taken steps to urge employers to make sure their workers are fully vaccinated or test negative before they come to the workplace.\n\u201cNo one wants to go to work and be worried they might come home to their family with a deadly virus,\" Murray said.\nThe White House sees the vaccinations as the quickest way to end a pandemic that has killed more than 780,000 people in the United States and is still evolving, as seen Wednesday with the country's first detected case of a troubling new variant. \nCourts have knocked back against the mandates, including a ruling this week blocking enforcement of a requirement for some health care workers.\nFor some Republicans, the court cases and lawmakers' fears about a potentially disruptive shutdown were factors against engaging in a high-stakes shutdown. \n\u201cOne of the things I\u2019m a little concerned about is: Why would we make ourselves the object of public attention by creating the specter of a government shutdown?\u201d said Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a GOP leader. \nThe administration has pursued vaccine requirements for several groups of workers, but the effort is facing legal setbacks.\nA federal judge this week blocked the administration from enforcing a vaccine mandate on thousands of health care workers in 10 states. Earlier, a federal appeals court temporarily halted the OSHA requirement affecting employers with 100 or more workers.\nThe administration has also put in place policies requiring millions of federal employees and federal contractors, including military troops, to be fully vaccinated. Those efforts are also under challenge.\nPolling from The Associated Press shows Americans are divided over Biden's effort to vaccinate workers, with Democrats overwhelmingly for it while most Republicans are against. \nSome Republicans prefer an effort from Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., to vote to reject the administration\u2019s mandates in a congressional review action expected next week, separate from the funding fight.\nSeparately, some health care providers protested the stopgap spending measure. Hospitals say it does nothing to shield them from Medicare payment cuts scheduled to go into effect amid uncertainty about the new omicron variant. \n_____\nAssociated Press staff writer Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar contributed to this report.7 Retail Stocks to Buy After Strong Quarterly EarningsEarnings season follows a predictable pattern. Bank stocks report first; then big tech stocks weigh in. And now, late in earnings season, we hear from the retail sector. Investors were expecting strong numbers and, for the most part, retailers delivered.\n\nHowever, for some retailers, this may become a \u201csell the news\u201d event.\n\nThat\u2019s because on August 16, before the big-name retailers reported, the U.S. Retail Sales Report showed a 1.1% decline in retail sales in July from June. So while retail sales for the last two quarters will be strong, investors are wondering if the sector is entering a period of slowing growth. Concern about the Delta variant perhaps bringing more restrictions to the retail sector adds to the concern.\n\nHowever, sectors don\u2019t move in lockstep. In every market, there are strong performers even in tough economic conditions. This was true during the pandemic. And it\u2019s true in the recovery. Summer is traditionally a slower season overall for retail. The July numbers probably do not reflect all of the back-to-school purchases. And, of course, stores are already beginning to prepare for the holiday season.View the \"7 Retail Stocks to Buy After Strong Quarterly Earnings\"."

Beijing sees that as a valuable asset and security risk.\nRegulators said in July they would step up scrutiny of tech companies with shares traded abroad and their information security and cross-border data flows. Didi\u2019s share price fell 25% after regulators launched an investigation into its handling of customer data following its June 30 stock market debut.\n\u201cAfter conscientious research, the company will start delisting operations on the New York Stock Exchange immediately and commence preparations to list in Hong Kong,\u201d Didi said on its social media account. A separate statement said U.S. shares would be converted into \u201cfreely tradable shares\u201d on another \u201cinternationally recognized\" exchange.\nHong Kong is Chinese territory but has a separate regulatory system that allows foreigners to invest in its stock market. Mainland markets are mostly off-limits to foreign capital.\nTech entrepreneurs who are largely shut out of the state-run financial system have raised billions of dollars abroad. But the ruling party worries about how that affects control of their companies. It is promising more access to capital within China.\nDidi Chuxing raised about $4.4 billion in its market debut. The company earlier denied a news report it planned to buy back its U.S. shares.\nOther companies including Alibaba Group, the world\u2019s biggest e-commerce company, and Tencent Holding, which operates the popular WeChat message service, also have been hit by data security and anti-monopoly probes.\nInvestor jitters about the crackdown have knocked more than $1 trillion off the total market value of Chinese tech companies on U.S. and other foreign exchanges.\nDidi was founded in 2012 by Alibaba veteran Will Wei Cheng. Its president is Jean Qing Liu, a former Goldman Sachs managing director and the daughter of Liu Chuanzhi, founder of computer maker Lenovo Group.\nIt expanded abroad in 2018 by acquiring Brazil\u2019s 99 Taxis and set up operations in Mexico. Didi operates in 16 countries, though almost 90% of the 493 million customers who used the service at least once in the past year are in China.\nDidi acquired rival Kuaidi in 2016 and Uber Technologies Inc.\u2019s China operation the following year. Other competitors in the $50 billion-a-year market include Caocao Chuxing, a unit of automaker Geely, and Hello Chuxing, backed by Alibaba.\nFollowing its investigation, China\u2019s cyberspace regulator said in July \u201cserious violations\u201d were found in how Didi collected and stored personal information. Didi was later ordered to remove 25 of its apps from online stores.\nChinese companies have sold shares abroad for two decades but regulators have yet to say whether their financial structures comply with rules that ban foreign ownership of internet companies and limit access to other industries.\nThe ruling party is trying to capture more of their value for the Chinese public by encouraging companies to sell shares on domestic markets.\nShares in a handful of mainland companies traded in Hong Kong can be bought by Chinese investors through mainland exchanges.

Australia's opposition leader says the nation would set a more ambitious target of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 43% by the end of the decade if the government changes at elections early next year. (Lukas Coch/AAP Image via AP)\nCANBERRA, Australia (AP) \u2014 Australia would set a more ambitious target of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 43% by the end of the decade if the government changes hands in elections early next year, the opposition leader said on Friday.\nCenter-left Labor Party leader Anthony Albanese set climate policy as a battle line at elections expected to be held between March and May.\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison was widely criticized at a U.N. climate summit in Scotland last month over his conservative government\u2019s target of reducing Australia\u2019s emissions by only 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2030.\nIt was the same target Australia adopted at the Paris summit in 2015, while other wealthy countries have pledged far deeper cuts in a bid to contain global warming to less than 1.5 degrees Celsius.\nAlbanese said a change of government would mean Australia would be able to attend the next international climate and \u201cnot be in the naughty corner.\u201d\nAustralia\u2019s economy was similar to Canada\u2019s and Labor's goal was similar to the Canadian target of reducing emissions by 40% to 45% by the end of the decade.\n\u201cWe think that we\u2019ve got absolutely the balance right because one of the things that I wanted to make sure is that we have a policy that doesn\u2019t leave people behind, that supports industry, that supports jobs,\u201d Albanese said.\nBut Morrison said Labor\u2019s target would increase electricity prices and cost jobs.\n\u201cWe\u2019re on our way to net zero by 2050,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cWe\u2019re not on our way to drive people out of their jobs and force up their electricity price.\u201d\nMorrison\u2019s coalition was narrowly re-elected in 2019 when Labor promised to cut emissions by 45% by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050.\nThe government has also recently adopted the net zero target.\nMorrison was a Cabinet minister in 2014 when a newly elected government repealed Australia\u2019s 2-year-old carbon tax. Government climate policies since have rejected any measures that would make polluters pay for their emissions.7 Fintech Stocks That Will Continue To Disrupt Traditional BankingIn April 2021, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon described fintech companies as one of the \u201cenormous competitive threats\u201d to traditional banking. And with good reason. Fintech (short for financial technology) is not just \u201cdigital banking.\u201d It\u2019s a different approach to banking that traditional banks will not be able to replicate by outspending their competitors.\n\nYou see, cryptocurrency is getting a lot of attention for the way it\u2019s disrupting the monetary system. But before there was bitcoin (CCC: BTC-USD), there was fintech.\n\nWhat started out as a way to send money from one person to another without the need for a bank (i.e. peer-to-peer lending) has morphed into much more. Today, individuals and businesses can get loans, invest, and pay bills conveniently and securely. And they can do so without ever having to set foot into a bank.\n\nFinancial technology is democratizing finance for many individuals who have been left behind by the traditional banking system. The \u201cunbanked\u201d is a huge target audience. But whereas fintech started as reaching those that were unbanked out of necessity; it is cultivating a new audience among those who are going unbanked by choice.\n\nIn this special presentation, we\u2019ll look at seven fintech companies that are leading in this space today and will do so well into the future.\nView the \"7 Fintech Stocks That Will Continue To Disrupt Traditional Banking\"."

This sector is at the intersection of multiple secular trends (e.g. autonomous driving, renewable energy). And, after years of false starts, it appears that EV technology is ready to be produced at scale.\n\nThink about this. There is an average of 90 million vehicles sold annually. That\u2019s units, not dollars. Total sales of vehicles topped $3.1 trillion in 2019, and the number is expected to grow over the long-term.\n\nThe EV market is less than 3% of global vehicle sales, but it\u2019s growing. EV is expected to account for more than 50% of the total auto-fleet by 2050, and that target could be reached much sooner if battery technology advances.\n\nWhen it comes to the EV market, it\u2019s a \u201crising tide lifts all ships\u201d kind of market, but there are still some clear winners to focus on. In this special presentation, we\u2019ll take a look at eight companies that are among the best in the current crop of EV and EV-related companies.\nView the \"8 EV Stocks To Electrify Your Growth Portfolio\"."

        "Article": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Authorities in Los Angeles on Thursday announced more than a dozen arrests in recent smash-and-grab thefts at stores where nearly $340,000 worth of merchandise was stolen, part of a rash of organized retail crime in California. \nFourteen people were arrested in connection with 11 brazen robberies between Nov. 18 and 28, and all are out of custody, police Chief Michel Moore said. Most bailed out or met no-bail criteria, and one is a juvenile, he said. \nAt a joint news conference, both Moore and Mayor Eric Garcetti called for an end to a no-bail policy for some defendants aimed at reducing overcrowding at Los Angeles County jails during the coronavirus pandemic.\nGarcetti said with the pandemic easing, it's time to make room again in lockups for criminals who commit violent acts and put store employees in danger. \n\u201cWe need the help of our criminal justice system, of our judges, of our jailers,\u201d Garcetti said. \u201cWe have opened up a lot of the city because we\u2019re in a better place with COVID. We should be able to also open up our jails, and we should be able to have judges that put people behind those bars.\u201d \nA statewide policy of imposing $0 bail for misdemeanors and lower-level felonies ended last year, but it was kept in place within the LA County Superior Court system. \nMoore said at least $338,000 in goods were stolen over ten days from stores and malls across the city that incurred $40,000 in property damage. Investigators are searching for multiple outstanding suspects, he said. \nThe incidents were part of a recent run of large-scale thefts in California and across the nation in which groups of individuals shoplift en masse from stores or smash and grab from display cases. Single operators have also been a growing problems for retailers who say the thieves face little consequence.\nThe chief said he was confident that police investigating the retail robberies had the support of Los Angeles District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n, who ran on a reform agenda and supports ending bail across the board for misdemeanor, non-violent and non-serious felony offenses. \nGasc\u00f3n's office said in a statement Thursday that those who commit smash-and-grab thefts will be held accountable. \n\"Our office has been collaborating with multiple law enforcement agencies and once all the evidence has been gathered, we will review the cases to determine what criminal charges should be filed,\" Alex Bastian, special advisor to Gasc\u00f3n, said in the statement. \u201cThese brazen acts hurt all of us: retailers, employees and customers alike.\u201d \nSan Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin last week announced felony charges against nine people for a series of thefts, and Bay Area prosecutors announced a joint effort to combat organized retail theft.\nIn the Bay Area, the City Council in Walnut Creek this week approved an additional $2 million for policing after nearly 100 thieves wearing ski masks carried out a smash-and-grab mob robbery at a Nordstrom store in November. An estimated $125,000 in merchandise was stolen. \nGov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who has boasted of his criminal justice reform efforts, promised on Wednesday that the proposed budget he sends to state lawmakers next month will \u201csignificantly increase our efforts to go after these retail rings.\u201d\nGarcetti sought to calm the nerves of Angelenos hoping to shop at stores and malls for the holiday season, saying that the relatively small number of crimes is \u201cno cause for alarm.\"\n\u201cWe're acting fast to stop this in its tracks,\" he said. \n___\nAssociated Press reporter Don Thompson contributed from Sacramento, Calif. 7 Stocks That are Ready For a Santa Claus RallyWith the end of the year approaching, many investors are looking to rebalance their portfolios. That typically means casting a critical eye at some of your strong performers and making a decision on whether they will move higher. And one thing that can dip the balance in favor of retaining a stock is the likelihood of a Santa Claus rally.\n\nThe technical definition of a Santa Claus rally is a rally that starts in the last few trading days of the year after the Christmas holiday. In recent years, however, that definition has been expanded to take into account a December rally. And with Black Friday beginning earlier and earlier and really not ending until after the holiday's end, this makes some sense.\n\nSo will there be a rally in 2021? I wouldn\u2019t bet against it. The market continues to want to move higher and January is historically a strong month for stocks. With that said, we believe quality should still matter. Here are seven stocks that stand to benefit with or without a Santa Claus rally.View the \"7 Stocks That are Ready For a Santa Claus Rally\"."

Three years later, a judge will begin hearing evidence on Wednesday, Dec. 1, 2021, in Los Angeles Superior Court that could undo a law that has already been credited with giving more women a seat in boardrooms.

California's first-in-the-nation law requiring women on corporate boards is being challenged in court this week on constitutional grounds. A trial begins Wednesday, Dec. 1, 2021, in a lawsuit by the conservative group Judicial Watch that claims spending taxpayer money to enforce the law violates the California Constitution. Berkhemer-Credaire, who lobbied in support of the law, said she's confident it will be upheld at trial. (Genaro Molina/Los Angeles Times via AP)\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A California official defending the state\u2019s landmark law that mandates women be placed on corporate boards testified Thursday that it was essentially toothless and there are no plans to penalize companies for not complying. \nUnder the 2018 law, publicly held corporations based in California have to appoint up to three women to their boards of directors by January and could face hefty fines for not doing so or for failing to file the required paperwork.\nBut Betsy Bogart, a division chief testifying in Los Angeles Superior Court on behalf of her boss, the secretary of state, said the law is not enforced. \n\u201cIt\u2019s required but there\u2019s no penalty, so it\u2019s essentially voluntary,\u201d Bogart said.\nThe disclosure came on the second day of trial in a lawsuit by the conservative legal group Judicial Watch that claims it's illegal to use taxpayer funds to enforce a law that violates the equal protection clause of the California Constitution by mandating a gender-based quota.\nDuring opening statements Wednesday in Los Angeles Superior Court, a deputy attorney general said the office would not levy fines for not complying with SB826, the Women on Boards law. \n\u201cThe secretary of state has no plans to draft regulations or implement fines in furtherance of the act,\u201d Deputy Attorney General Ashante Norton said. \nNorton defended the law as constitutional and necessary to reverse a culture of discrimination that favors men. She said no additional funding was spent implementing it and the law served a compelling government interest that improved companies bottom lines and the state's economy. \nThe law required publicly held companies headquartered in California to have one member who identifies as a woman on their boards of directors by the end of 2019. By January, boards with five directors must have two women and boards with six or more members must have three women.\nThe law called for penalties ranging from $100,000 fines for failing to report board compositions to the California secretary of state\u2019s office. Companies that do not include the required number of female board members can be fined $100,000 for first violations and $300,000 for subsequent violations.\nBogart said there were no penalties if a company lied about the makeup of its board and there was no follow up if they failed to file the required report. \nFewer than half the nearly 650 applicable corporations in the state reported last year that they had complied. More than half didn\u2019t file the required disclosure statement, according to the most recent report.\nA document entered as evidence revealed that then-Secretary of State Alex Padilla had warned the governor that his office couldn't enforce the law as it was written.\nTwo weeks before then-Gov. Jerry Brown signed the bill into law in September 2018, Padilla wrote him a letter stating he supported the \u201cadmirable objectives\u201d of the law but said his office didn't have the capacity or authority to collect fines.\n\"Any attempt by the secretary of state to collect or enforce the fine would likely exceed its authority,\u201d Padilla wrote. \nPadilla said it would cost more than $10 million to create infrastructure for the program. Fines anticipated would be inadequate to fund the estimated $900,000 it would cost each year to maintain it. \nHe said the bill would only provide an incentive as long as there was enforcement. \nBrown noted when he signed the bill that the law could be overturned in court but he wanted to send a message during the #MeToo era.\nSupporters of the law said it has already been successful and a few other states have either passed similar legislation or were considering bills that would put more women on boards. \nBefore the California law went into effect, women held 17% of the seats on company boards in the state, based on the Russell 3000 Index of the largest companies in the U.S., according to the advocacy group 50/50 Women on Boards. As of September, the percentage of board seats held by women climbed to more than 30% in California, compared to 26% nationally.\nStill, some 40% of the largest companies in California need to add women to their boards to comply with the law, the group said. \nBogart said the focus had been on education and outreach, sending a letter to corporations to notify them of the law. She said the office did not plan to send such a letter this year. \nWhen asked if the secretary of state would never enforce the law in whole or part, she said she couldn\u2019t say. \n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you if we\u2019ll never do it,\u201d she said. \nHowever, she repeatedly told Norton that there were no plans to implement regulations around SB826 or to collect fines. \nShe said they were enforcing the part of the law that required annual reports but that fines were discretionary. \nThe nonjury trial in Los Angeles Superior Court is expected to take six to seven days and will focus on a legal question. Judge Maureen Duffy-Lewis will rule whether the law is constitutional. 7 Undervalued Stocks in an Overvalued MarketIn June 2021 the investment firm, Bespoke Investments made this ominous pronouncement: \u201cInvestors simultaneously think the market is overvalued, but likely to keep climbing.\u201d\n\nThis statement was meant to be a warning to investors. However, investors have shown that they can be very resilient even as the major indices continue to reach new highs.\n\nSo it would seem strange to be looking at a list of undervalued stocks. But looking at undervalued stocks is a form of value investing. And in 2021, investors are shifting between growth and value investing on a monthly, if not weekly basis.\n\nAn undervalued stock is one that is considered to be trading below its fair value. However, there\u2019s no singular right way to identify undervalued stocks. Some investors prefer to look at fundamental metrics. Others will look for technical signals.\n\nThe one common element of all undervalued stocks is that they are stocks that have room to grow. That\u2019s something that all investors can get behind. And in this special presentation, we\u2019ll take a look at seven stocks that are showing signs of being undervalued at this time.\nView the \"7 Undervalued Stocks in an Overvalued Market\"."

Awful events like this show how much more work is needed for us to coexist with these vitally important animals.\"\nA group of conservation and animal protection groups late Thursday said they were offering a combined $26,000 in rewards for information leading to a conviction in the poisonings. The rewards were offered by the Center for Biological Diversity, Cascadia Wildlands, Defenders of Wildlife, The Humane Society of the United States, Northeast Oregon Ecosystems, Oregon Wild, Predator Defense and WildEarth Guardians.\nWolves once ranged most of the U.S. but were wiped out in most places by the 1930s under government-sponsored poisoning and trapping campaigns.\nMore than 2,000 wolves occupy six states in the Northern Rockies and Pacific Northwest after animals from Canada were reintroduced in Idaho and Yellowstone National Park starting in 1995.\nHowever, wolves remain absent across most of their historical range. Wildlife advocates argue that continued protections are needed so they can continue to expand in California, Colorado, Oregon and other states.\nThe Fish and Wildlife Division of the Oregon State Police was alerted on Feb. 9 that a collared wolf from the Catherine Pack was possibly deceased.\nTroopers responded and located five deceased wolves, three males, and two females. The wolves were located southeast of Mount Harris, within Union County. Investigators also found a dead magpie in the vicinity of the dead wolves, the agency said.\nThe animals were sent to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service forensics lab in Ashland to determine the cause of death. \nOn March 11, State Police were told a mortality signal from an additional wolf collar had been received in the same general location. Searchers found a deceased female wolf, a skunk, and a magpie all very close to the scene. The female wolf was determined to be a member of the Keating Pack.\nIn April, the federal lab released findings consistent with poisoning as the cause of death for all six wolves, the skunk, and two magpies.\nIn addition, two more collared wolves were found deceased in Union County after the initial incidents. In April, a deceased adult male wolf from the Five Points Pack was located west of Elgin, and in July a young female wolf from the Clark Creek Pack was located northeast of La Grande, the county seat.\nToxicology reports confirmed the presence of differing types of poison in both those wolves, the OSP said.7 Trucking Stocks That Are About to Go On a RollAmericans are facing a historic supply chain crisis. The solutions are simple on the one hand and\nmaddeningly complex on the other. And no industry embodies that complexity more than the trucking\nindustry. Just getting the barges unloaded will not be enough. Those goods have to be transported to a\nfinal destination.\n\nFor that, we\u2019re going to need trucks. And those trucks will need drivers. According to the American\nTrucking Association (ATA), approximately 70% of consumer goods in the United States are transported\nby trucks. However, for a variety of reasons, the industry faces a shortage of qualified drivers.\n\nHow extreme is that shortage? The ATA estimates that the shortage of qualified truck drivers sits at over\n50,000 and continues to grow. In fact, it suggests that over 900,000 drivers are needed and there simply\nare not enough qualified drivers to meet that demand.\n\nWe\u2019re not going to see one million new drivers on the road by the end of the year. And even if we did,\ntrucking companies will be a beneficiary as the industry rises to meet this moment. This also means that\ninvestors should be eyeing trucking stocks. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve prepared this special presentation\nwhich identifies seven trucking stocks that are excellent opportunities at this time.View the \"7 Trucking Stocks That Are About to Go On a Roll\"."

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The risk of a short-term government shutdown appeared to be easing late Thursday as the Senate pushed toward final approval of a bill that would fund the government through Feb. 18, sending the measure to President Joe Biden for his signature.\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters it was \u201clooking good\u201d that senators would pass the bill and \u201cmake sure the government stays open.\u201d\nThe measure has been held up for days, and it was not immediately clear how the Senate would resolve a standoff with some conservative Republicans who threatened to stall the bill in hopes of forcing a debate over Biden\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine mandates. Some GOP senators said they would not support an expedited vote on the spending measure without also taking up a vote that would prevent funding for enforcement of a vaccine mandate for large employers. \nBut a vote was expected later Thursday.\nEarlier in the day, congressional leaders announced they had finally reached an agreement to keep the government running for 11 more weeks, generally at current spending levels, while adding $7 billion to aid Afghanistan evacuees.\nThe Democratic-led House passed the measure Thursday by a 221-212 vote. The Republican leadership urged members to vote no; the lone GOP vote for the bill came from Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger.\nLawmakers bemoaned the short-term fix and blamed the opposing party for the lack of progress on this year's spending bills. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, chair of the House Appropriations Committee, said the measure would, however, allow for negotiations on a package covering the full budget year through September.\n\u201cMake no mistake, a vote against this continuing resolution is a vote to shut government down,\" DeLauro said during the House debate.\nBefore the House acted, Biden said he had spoken with Senate leaders and he played down fears of a shutdown.\n\u201cThere is a plan in place unless somebody decides to be totally erratic, and I don\u2019t think that will happen,\" Biden said.\nThe House vote sent the measure to the Senate. Conservative Republicans opposed to Biden\u2019s vaccine rules want Congress to take a hard stand against the mandated shots for workers at larger businesses, even if that meant shutting down federal offices over the weekend by blocking a request that would expedite a final vote on the spending bill. \nIt was just the latest instance of the brinkmanship around government funding that has triggered several costly shutdowns and partial closures over the past two decades. The longest shutdown in history happened under President Donald Trump \u2014 35 days stretching into January 2019, when Democrats refused to approve money for his U.S-Mexico border wall. Both parties agree the stoppages are irresponsible, yet few deadlines pass without a late scramble to avoid them.\nDemocrats were able to use their majority in the House to advance the spending bill. They have a more difficult task in the 50-50 Senate, where objections by just one senator can slow a final vote past Friday's midnight deadline.\nSen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said Democrats knew last month that several Republicans would use all means at their disposal to oppose legislation that funds or allows the enforcement of the employer vaccine mandate. He blamed Schumer, D-N.Y., for not negotiating and for ignoring their position.\nIf the choice is between \u201csuspending nonessential functions\u201d or standing idle while Americans lose their ability to work, \u201cI\u2019ll stand with American workers every time,\u201d Lee said.\nGOP senators said the idea is to vote on stripping money that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration would use to implement the requirement that private employers with 100 or more workers ensure they are vaccinated or regularly tested. A vote on such a measure would then ease prospects for the Senate to take up the full bill on an expedited basis.\n\u201cThis is a chance to correct a wrong,\u201d said Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., who undertook a similar effort against vaccine mandates during the last government funding standoff.\nSchumer said early Thursday it was \u201cnot easy to reach this deal\" and while most Republicans do not want a shutdown, a \u201cfew individual Republican senators appear determined to derail this important legislation because of their opposition to the president's lifesaving vaccine guidelines.\"\n\u201cLet's be clear, if there is a shutdown, it will be a Republican, anti-vaccine shutdown,\" Schumer said.\nThe White House sees the vaccinations as the quickest way to end a pandemic that has killed more than 780,000 people in the United States and is still evolving, as seen Wednesday with the country's first detected case of a troubling new variant. \nCourts have knocked back against the mandates, including a ruling this week blocking enforcement of a requirement for some health care workers.\nFor some Republicans, the court cases and lawmakers' fears about a potentially disruptive shutdown are factors against engaging in a high-stakes shutdown. \n\u201cOne of the things I\u2019m a little concerned about is: Why would we make ourselves the object of public attention by creating the specter of a government shutdown?\u201d said Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a GOP leader. \nThe administration has pursued vaccine requirements for several groups of workers, but the effort is facing legal setbacks.\nA federal judge this week blocked the administration from enforcing a vaccine mandate on thousands of health care workers in 10 states. Earlier, a federal appeals court temporarily halted the OSHA requirement affecting employers with 100 or more workers.\nThe administration has also put in place policies requiring millions of federal employees and federal contractors, including military troops, to be fully vaccinated. Those efforts are also under challenge.\nPolling from The Associated Press shows Americans are divided over Biden's effort to vaccinate workers, with Democrats overwhelmingly for it while most Republicans are against. \nSome Republicans prefer an effort from Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., to vote to reject the administration\u2019s mandates in a congressional review action expected next week, separate from the funding fight.\nSeparately, some health care providers protested the stopgap spending measure. Hospitals say it does nothing to shield them from Medicare payment cuts scheduled to go into effect amid uncertainty about the new omicron variant. \n_____\nAssociated Press staff writer Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar contributed to this report.7 Travel Stocks to Buy as Summer Kicks Into High GearThe last 18 months have created much uncertainty in the market.

They need families, they need to see people, obviously safely, socially distancing, but I really think, this Christmas now, people have had enough,\u201d said Belinda Storey, who runs a stall at a Christmas market in Nottingham, England.\nIn the Netherlands, where the lockdown went into effect last week, mounted police patrol the streets to break up demonstrations. But most people appeared resigned to rush through errands and head home. \n\u201cThe only thing we can do is to listen to the rules, follow them and hope it\u2019s not getting worse. For me it\u2019s no problem. I\u2019m a nurse. I know how sick people get,\" said Wilma van Kampen. \nHuburt Bruls, who as mayor of the Dutch city of Nijmegen banned a protest last weekend, said he sympathized with the frustration but was prepared to carry out the national rules.\n\u201cThere was a lot of disappointment in the effects of vaccination. Everybody did their best, we had one of the highest rates of vaccinations, and it wasn\u2019t enough. Infections are higher than ever. I myself was a little disappointed, but we have to look ahead,\u201d he said.\nIn Greece, residents over 60 face fines of 100 euros ($113) a month if they fail to get vaccinated. The fines will be tacked onto tax bills in January. About 17% of Greeks over 60 are unvaccinated despite various efforts to prod them to get their shots, and nine in 10 Greeks now dying of COVID-19 are over 60.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care whether the measure will cost me some extra votes in the elections,\u201d Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said Wednesday after lawmakers passed the measure. \u201cI am convinced that we are doing the right thing, and I am convinced that this policy will save lives.\"\nEmploying a carrot instead of a stick, Slovakia\u2019s government is proposing to give people 60 and older a 500-euro ($568) bonus if they get vaccinated.\nIn Israel, the government this week briefly resumed using a phone-monitoring technology to perform contact tracing of people confirmed to have the omicron variant, only to halt its use on Thursday.\n\u201cFrom the beginning I noted that use of this tool would be limited and brief \u2014 for a few days, in order to get urgent information to halt infection with the new, unknown variant,\u201d Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz said on Twitter.\nIn South Africa, which alerted the World Health Organization to the omicron variant, previous restrictions included curfews and a ban on alcohol sales. This time, President Cyril Ramaphosa is simply calling on more people to get vaccines \u201cto help restore the social freedoms we all yearn for.\u201d\nGermany on Thursday imposed strict new limitations on the unvaccinated, excluding them from nonessential stores, restaurants, and other major public venues. They can go to work only with a negative test.\nThe legislature is expected to take up a general vaccine mandate in coming weeks.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said the measures were necessary because hospitals risked becoming overloaded: \u201cThe situation in our country is serious.\u201d\nIn the U.S., there is little appetite in either political party for a return to lockdowns or strict contact tracing. Enforcing even simple measures like mask-wearing has become a political flashpoint. And Republicans are suing to block the Biden administration\u2019s new get-vaccinated-or-get-tested requirement for large employers.\nOn Thursday, President Joe Biden, whose political fate may well hinge on controlling the pandemic, moved to tighten testing requirements for people entering the U.S., and recommended Americans wear masks indoors in public. But he said his new strategy \u201cdoesn\u2019t include shutdowns and lockdowns,\u201d and he hoped for bipartisan backing.\n\"It's a plan that I think should unite us,\u201d he said.\nThe rise of the new variant makes little difference to Mark Christensen, a grain buyer for an ethanol plant in Nebraska. He rejects any vaccination mandate and doesn\u2019t understand why it would be needed. In any event, he said, most businesses in his corner of the state are too small to fall under the regulations.\n\u201cIf they were just encouraging me to take it, that\u2019s one thing,\u201d Christensen said. \u201cBut I believe in freedom of choice, not decisions by force.\u201d\nChile has taken a harder line since the emergence of omicron: People over 18 must receive a booster dose every six months to keep their pass that allows access to restaurants, hotels and public gatherings.\nDr. Madhukar Pai, of McGill University\u2019s School of Population and Public Health, said that masks are an easy and pain-free way of keeping transmission down, but that cheap, at-home tests need to be much more widespread, in both rich and poor countries.\nHe said both approaches give people a sense of control over their own behavior that is lost with a lockdown and make it easier to accept the need to do things like cancel a party or stay inside.\nPai said requiring boosters universally, as is essentially the case in Israel, Chile and many countries in Europe, including France, will only prolong the pandemic by making it harder to get first doses to the developing world. That raises the odds of still more variants.\nLockdowns, he said, should be the very last choice.\n\u201cLockdowns only come up when a system is failing,\" he said. \"We do it when the hospital system is about to collapse. It\u2019s a last resort that indicates you have failed to do all the right things.\" \n___\nAssociated Press journalists Nicholas Paphitis in Athens, Greece; Tia Goldenberg in Jerusalem; Aleks Furtula in Nijmegen, Netherlands; Zeke Miller in Washington; Frank Jordans in Berlin; Patricia Luna in Santiago, Chile; Grant Schulte in Lincoln, Nebraska; Andrew Meldrum in Johannesburg; Huizhong Wu in Taipei, Taiwan, and Chen Si in Shanghai contributed.\n___\nFollow AP\u2019s coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic7 Cyclical Stocks That Make Sense In a Volatile MarketDespite many predictions of an imminent, and possibly severe, market correction, 2021 has been a great year for investors.

Starbucks is fighting an expanded effort to unionize its stores. The effort comes even as a union vote proceeds at three of the coffee chain's locations in Buffalo, New York.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Thompson, File).\nStarbucks is fighting an expanded effort to unionize its stores, even as a union vote proceeds at three of the coffee-chain's locations in Buffalo, New York.\nUnion organizers from three additional Buffalo-area stores appeared before the National Labor Relations Board on Thursday, asking to hold union votes at each of their stores. The workers say they want more input on pay and store operations and they're seeking representation by Workers United, an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union.\nStarbucks\u2019 attorney at the hearing reiterated the company\u2019s request to conduct one vote with all 20 stores in the Buffalo area. The labor board hearing is expected to last for several days.\nIn late October, the labor board in the Buffalo region approved union votes at three separate Buffalo-area stores. Starbucks has appealed that ruling to the full labor board in Washington, but voting began last month despite that appeal. \nThe labor board could count those votes as early as Dec. 9. Starbucks has said around 111 employees are eligible to vote at those three stores.\nStarbucks has never had unionized workers at its U.S. stores in its 50-year history. The Seattle-based company says its 8,000 company-owned U.S. stores function best when it has flexibility and can work directly with employees.\nStarbucks attorney Alan Model noted Thursday that 45.5% of baristas and shift supervisors in the Buffalo area worked at more than one store in the company\u2019s 2021 fiscal year, which ended Oct. 3. That helps the company meet shifting customer demand at its locations, Model said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s by design, not happenstance, that you can walk into any store and enjoy the same food and beverage in any store, and its partners can work at any store at any time,\u201d Model told a hearing officer from the labor board.\nBut Ian Hayes, an attorney for Workers United, said the labor board has already determined that individual store union elections are appropriate. Hayes says store managers handle operations in any given store. \n\u201cLabor relations takes place at the store level,\u201d he said. Hayes also said it\u2019s uncommon for baristas to work at different stores.\nThe outcome of the union election at the first three Buffalo-area stores is still uncertain. \nIf the National Labor Relations Board denies Starbucks\u2019 request for a review of the regional decision, the ballots will be counted on Dec. 9. If the full board decides to review the decision, the ballots will be impounded until the board decides whether to keep the regional decision in place. \nIn the meantime, the unionization effort is spreading. On Nov. 18, workers at a Starbucks store in Mesa, Arizona, filed paperwork with the labor relations board asking for their own union election. 7 Stocks That are Ready For a Santa Claus RallyWith the end of the year approaching, many investors are looking to rebalance their portfolios. That typically means casting a critical eye at some of your strong performers and making a decision on whether they will move higher. And one thing that can dip the balance in favor of retaining a stock is the likelihood of a Santa Claus rally.\n\nThe technical definition of a Santa Claus rally is a rally that starts in the last few trading days of the year after the Christmas holiday. In recent years, however, that definition has been expanded to take into account a December rally. And with Black Friday beginning earlier and earlier and really not ending until after the holiday's end, this makes some sense.\n\nSo will there be a rally in 2021? I wouldn\u2019t bet against it. The market continues to want to move higher and January is historically a strong month for stocks. With that said, we believe quality should still matter. Here are seven stocks that stand to benefit with or without a Santa Claus rally.View the \"7 Stocks That are Ready For a Santa Claus Rally\"."

(AP Photo/Manu Fernandez, File)\nThe Federal Trade Commission on Thursday sued to block graphics chip maker Nvidia\u2019s $40 billion purchase of chip designer Arm, saying the deal would create a powerful company that could hurt the growth of new technologies. \nNvidia Corp., based in Santa Clara, California, said in September 2020 that it was buying United Kingdom-based Arm Ltd. from Japanese technology giant Softbank to \u201ccreate the world\u2019s premier computing company for the age of AI.\"\nBut the deal immediately raised concerns that Arm would abandon its business model of licensing chip designs to hundreds of tech companies, including many of Nvidia\u2019s competitors. \nMany of the world\u2019s smartphones run on Arm\u2019s chip designs and it is a vital supplier for companies like Apple and Samsung. It\u2019s also an innovator in chip technology that can power artificial intelligence for connected devices like medical sensors. Nvidia's chips are essential to computers and data centers and the company says it has a wide range of competitors, from chip makers like AMD, Intel and Qualcomm, to computer networking provider Cisco and tech giants Google and Amazon.\n\u201cThe FTC is suing to block the largest semiconductor chip merger in history to prevent a chip conglomerate from stifling the innovation pipeline for next-generation technologies,\u201d FTC Bureau of Competition Director Holly Vedova said in a news release. \u201cThis proposed deal would distort Arm\u2019s incentives in chip markets and allow the combined firm to unfairly undermine Nvidia\u2019s rivals.\u201d\nThe deal would give the combined company control over technology that rival firms need to develop their own chips, the FTC alleged. That would harm competition in markets where Nvidia uses Arm-based designs, the FTC says, including systems in cars that do things like automate lane changes and prevent collisions, and data centers critical to cloud computing. \nRegulators in the U.K. and the European Union have also opened investigations into the deal, citing competition concerns.\nNvidia said it will \u201ccontinue to work to demonstrate that this transaction will benefit the industry and promote competition.\u201d It said it will \u201cvigorously contest\u201d the FTC's lawsuit. \nThe company added that it is \u201ccommitted to preserving Arm\u2019s open licensing model and ensuring that its IP is available to all interested licensees, current and future.\u201d\nAn Arm spokesperson referred questions to Nvidia. A Softbank spokesperson did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\nThe FTC said its four commissioners voted unanimously to file the complaint and a trial is scheduled to begin in August 2022.\nPresident Joe Biden has called for federal regulators to give closer scrutiny to mergers and aimed at anticompetitive conduct in U.S. industry. He installed Big Tech critic Lina Khan as head of the FTC.

(DroneBase via AP, File)\n\nOil giant BP agreed Thursday to pay a $512,450 penalty and reduce soot emissions from its Whiting refinery in Indiana under an agreement with regulators and activists who accused the company of violating an earlier deal.\nThe U.S. District Court settlement modifies a previous consent decree that required BP Products North America Inc. to limit releases from the sprawling facility on the southwestern shore of Lake Michigan.\n\u201cToday\u2019s agreement should significantly reduce fine particle pollution from BP\u2019s refinery and ensure that violations of emission limits are reported and quickly corrected,\u201d said Eric Schaeffer, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project and a former enforcement director with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\nThe refinery 15 miles (24 kilometers) southeast of Chicago converts around 440,000 barrels of crude oil daily into gasoline, other fuels and asphalt.

(Grigory Sysoev, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP)\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met face-to-face with his Russian counterpart on Thursday to demand Russia pull back troops from the border with Ukraine, as tensions and suspicions grow in a confrontation over Ukraine's increasingly close ties with NATO and the West. \nRussia on one side and Ukraine, the U.S. and its NATO allies on the other traded fresh accusations and threats. The West, fearing that Moscow could invade Ukraine, threatened the Kremlin with the toughest sanctions yet if it launches an attack. Russia, seeing new U.S. and European support for Ukraine\u2019s military, sternly warned that any presence of NATO troops and weapons on Ukrainian soil represents a \u201cred line.\u201d\nFears that Russia would invade its neighbor or seek to undermine the government of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy have dominated Blinken's travels this week to meet with European allies. \nBlinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met Thursday on the sidelines of a ministerial meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in Stockholm, Sweden.\n\u201cThe United States and our allies and partners are deeply concerned by evidence that Russia has made plans for significant aggressive moves against Ukraine, including efforts to destabilize Ukraine from within and large-scale military operations,\" Blinken told reporters.\nDuring his meeting with Blinken, Lavrov charged that the West was \u201cplaying with fire\u201d by denying Russia a say in any further NATO expansion into countries of the former Soviet Union. Zelenskyy has pushed for Ukraine to join the alliance, which holds out the promise of membership but hasn't set a a timeline. \n\u201cI want to make it crystal clear: Turning our neighbors into a bridgehead for confrontation with Russia, the deployment of NATO forces in the regions strategically important for our security, is categorically unacceptable,\u201d Lavrov said he told the OSCE meeting.\nThe United States and its European allies have struggled to warn Russia off any military action and reaffirm support for Ukraine without moving so forcefully as to give Russian President Vladimir Putin a pretext to invade. \nAmerican officials and their allies acknowledge the uncertainties, including whether Putin is prepared to invade Ukraine or is maneuvering to bring President Joe Biden into one-on-one talks on security concessions. \nPutin said Wednesday that Moscow would seek Western guarantees precluding any further NATO expansion and deployment of its weapons near Russia\u2019s borders. Lavrov followed up on Putin\u2019s call for a new security arrangement, stating that reaching an agreement on a set of \u201clong-term and legally binding security guarantees is imperative to prevent sliding into a confrontational scenario.\u201d\nAlexander Vershbow, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia and former deputy secretary general of NATO, said he sees little or no prospect of the U.S. or NATO providing Putin with such guarantees. \u201cHe\u2019s simply not going to get\u201d an agreement to rule out further NATO expansion, Vershbow told The Associated Press. \nVershbow also ruled out the U.S. or NATO agreeing to halt the kind of military assistance they have been providing to Ukraine since 2014, including arms, training and intelligence sharing. \nRussia and Ukraine have remained locked in a tense tug-of-war since Russia annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula in 2014 following the ouster of the country\u2019s Kremlin-friendly president and threw its weight behind a separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine, which has killed more than 14,000.\nVershbow said Russia would not have an easy time if it chose to invade Ukraine, whose military is better equipped and more capable than it was in 2014. \u201cIt would be very costly for the Russians in terms of casualties,\u201d he said.\nUkraine and the U.S. estimate that Russia has at least 90,000 troops on its border with Ukraine, while Russia charged this week that Ukraine has amassed about 125,000 troops, or about half its military, near the rebel-controlled areas in the east.\nAddressing the OSCE meeting, Blinken urged Russia \u201cto respect Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity to de-escalate, reverse the recent troop buildup\" and \u201creturn forces to normal peaceful positions.\u201d\nThe Kremlin has voiced concern that Ukraine may use force to reclaim control of the rebel east. And adding to the tensions, the head of a Russian-allied, self-proclaimed separatist republic in the east appeared on Russian state television to say that he could turn to Moscow for military assistance if the region faced a Ukrainian attack. \nUkrainian officials have denied an intention to reclaim the rebel regions by force.\nBlinken sought Thursday to pre-empt Russian claims that Ukraine was threatening Russian interests. \u201cUkraine is in no way posing a threat to Russia or seeking a confrontation that would justify a Russian military intervention,\u201d the American secretary of state insisted. \nBlinken also met separately with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. Kuleba tweeted afterward that Ukraine and the United States \u201care closely working together on developing a comprehensive deterrence package, including severe economic sanctions, to demotivate Russia from further aggressive moves.\u201d\nJohn Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, said Thursday that Putin appeared to be \u201ctesting Ukraine. He\u2019s testing the West.\u201d \nHerbst, in a discussion at the Atlantic Council think tank, argued the Biden administration\u2019s response has been strong so far, leaving Putin \u201choping now simply to get some sort of concession either from Ukraine or perhaps from the United States.\u201d\n\u201cPutin is definitely as serious as he could be\u201d in the standoff, countered Ukraine analyst Hanna Shelest. \n___\nIsachenkov reported from Moscow.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew)\nA broad rally on Wall Street pushed stocks higher Thursday, giving the S&P 500 its best day in seven weeks as the market recouped some of its losses after several days of volatile trading. \nThe benchmark index rose 1.4%, its biggest gain since mid-October. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.8%, its best showing since early March. The tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 0.8%, held back in part by a modest drop in Apple.\nSmaller company stocks, which have lost the most ground this week, outpaced the broader market, sending the Russell 2000 index 2.7% higher. \nThe market rebound comes as investors try to gauge the amount of damage the omicron variant of COVID-19 might inflict on the economy, as well as measures that the U.S. and other governments are taking to restrain it. Trading has been choppy all week and, despite the latest gains, every major index is on track for a weekly loss.\nThe heavy selling in recent days may have presented too tempting an opportunity for traders, said Jay Hatfield, CEO of Infrastructure Capital Advisors.\n\u201cIt\u2019s bargain-hunting after an overreaction,\u201d Hatfield said. \u201cClearly the Fed and the variant are overhanging on the market, but the fundamentals are very strong and the Fed is still injecting liquidity into the market.\u201d\nThe S&P 500 rose 64.06 points to 4,577.10. The index has been on a roller coaster ride throughout the week. It was up as much as 1.9% Wednesday before skidding and closing 1.2% lower.\nThe Dow gained 617.75 points to 34,639.79. The Nasdaq added 127.27 points to 15,381.32. The Russell 2000 picked up 58.91 points to 2,206.33.\nThe latest coronavirus variant has led countries to impose barriers to travel and stricter restrictions on business and people. Concerns about global restrictions potentially crimping economic growth butted up against concerns about rising inflation this week. The persistence of rising inflation has prompted the Federal Reserve to consider withdrawing stimulus measures sooner than expected.\nWall Street will likely remain jumpy until investors have more information on how contagious the new variant is and how well current vaccines will hold up against it. \nMore than 90% of companies in the S&P 500 index rose Thursday. Banks and other financial companies accounted for a big slice of the gains. Bank of America rose 2.9% and American Express rose 4.5%.\nTechnology companies also rose, but the gains were crimped by a 0.6% drop from Apple after the iPhone maker reportedly warned suppliers that it is seeing weak demand ahead of the holiday season.\nBond yields rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 1.44% from 1.43% late Wednesday.\nU.S. crude oil prices rose 1.4%. OPEC and allied oil-producing countries decided Thursday to stick to their plans to boost output via steady, modest monthly increases in oil releases, even as the omicron variant adds more uncertainty over the global economic recovery from the pandemic. Energy companies gained ground. Chevron rose 2.7%.\nTravel-related companies, which got hammered earlier this week as worries about the new coronavirus variant swept markets, rebounded Thursday. American Airlines climbed 7%, while Delta Air Lines rose 9.3%. Cruise line operators Carnival and Norwegian Cruise Line jumped 9.2% and 7.7%, respectively.\nSeveral companies made outsized gains on a mix of corporate news. Supermarket chain Kroger jumped 11% for the biggest gain in the S&P 500 after raising its profit forecast for the year. Software maker Synopsys gained 4.5% after also giving investors an encouraging profit forecast. \n\nBoeing rose 7.5% after China\u2019s aviation regulator cleared the airplane maker\u2019s 737 Max to return to flying with technical upgrades.\nSoutheast Asia\u2019s largest ride-hailing company Grab fell 20.5% in its market debut Thursday, following a $40 billion merger in a special purpose acquisition company deal.Should you invest $1,000 in Kroger right now?Before you consider Kroger, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

Members of the United Auto Workers union have overwhelmingly approved picking their leaders by direct ballot elections, Thursday, Dec. 2, rejecting a system that many blamed for a bribery and embezzlement scandal in the union's top ranks. (AP Photo/Carlos Osorio, File)\nDETROIT (AP) \u2014 Members of the United Auto Workers union have overwhelmingly approved picking their leaders by direct ballot elections, rejecting a system that many blamed for a bribery and embezzlement scandal in the union's top ranks.\nThe \u201cone member, one vote\u201d measure got about 64% of 140,586 valid ballots that were received by Monday\u2019s mail-in deadline.\nOnly about 36% favored the current system of leadership picked by delegates to a convention, according to results released Thursday.\nThe results are not official until approved by the Labor Department and a federal judge.\nA court-appointed monitor will develop rules and oversee the election of the union's 13-member International Executive Board, which includes the president, three vice presidents, secretary-treasurer and regional directors. All current board members including President Ray Curry are expected to run. \nThe monitor, Neil Barofsky, said Thursday in a statement that the election is likely to take place in the summer or fall of next year. \nThe change is a dramatic one for the 86-year-old union with 397,000 members nationwide. In the past, union leaders were chosen every four years at a convention, with the delegates picked by local union offices. But the new slate of leaders is picked by the outgoing president, and seldom has there been any serious opposition. \nDirect elections received 89,615 votes, while 50,971 wanted delegate voting. Over 1 million active members and retirees were eligible to vote. \nBarofsky was appointed by a federal judge earlier this year as part of a settlement that avoided a government takeover of the union after a wide-ranging bribery and embezzlement scandal. The vote on direct election of leaders also was part of the settlement.\nPeggy Jones, a worker at General Motors\u2019 truck assembly plant in Flint, Michigan, said she voted to keep the delegate system but understands that many workers are upset with and don\u2019t trust union leaders because of the scandal. \nJones said she voted for the delegate system for fear that smaller industries and locals won\u2019t be represented under the direct election system. She\u2019s also afraid that some fringe members without experience could be elected. \n\u201cYou don\u2019t want someone in here that doesn\u2019t have experience,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a whole lot of good people in the UAW. I have trust in the people who are left.\u201d\nBut Eric Truss, who makes axles for Ford F-150 pickup trucks at the company\u2019s Rouge complex in Dearborn, Michigan, said he voted for direct elections to hold leaders accountable. \n\u201cThey know if they\u2019re not listening to their members, they won\u2019t be back in office next time around,\u201d said Truss, a member of a union caucus formed to oppose leaders after news of the scandal broke.\nMany members, he said, were upset because dues were misused by union leaders after they were raised at the last union convention. \nTruss said he's not worried about the automotive sector of the union dominating other groups such as aerospace and higher education and says those groups weren\u2019t being represented in the past by union leaders.\nDirect elections, he said, will give groups outside of automotive a voice at the table.\nThe vote and monitor are part of a December 2020 deal between former UAW President Rory Gamble and ex-U.S. Attorney Matthew Schneider in Detroit that held off moves by the government to take over the union.\nSchneider and many members viewed direct elections as a way to hold union leaders accountable for their actions. \nBut Gamble, who retired June 30, said at the time that direct elections would let anti-union groups put out disinformation. He added that the delegate system gives minorities, women and members outside of the automobile sector a voice in picking leaders.\nGamble, who was replaced by Curry, was not charged in the federal probe. He has said the union is now clean and has safeguards in place to prevent the scandal from happening again.\nEleven union officials and a late official\u2019s spouse have pleaded guilty in the corruption probe since 2017, including the two presidents who served before Gamble, Gary Jones and Dennis Williams. Both were sentenced to prison. \nNot all of the convictions were linked. The first wave, which included some Fiat Chrysler employees, involved money paid as bribes from a Fiat Chrysler-UAW training center in Detroit. Jones and Williams were caught in an embezzlement scheme with the leaders taking thousands of dollars of union money to buy golf clubs, booze, lavish meals and to rent expensive villas in Palm Springs, California. \nDuring the probe, Schneider, who led the investigation, said the corruption was so deep that the federal government may take over the union.\nThe U.S. attorney\u2019s office said it uncovered embezzlement of over $1.5 million in dues money, kickbacks to union officials from vendors and $3.5 million in illegal payments from executives at Fiat Chrysler who wanted to corruptly influence contract talks. \nBarofsky, who will stay in place for six years unless both sides agree to a shorter term, leads the law firm Jenner & Block\u2019s monitorship practice.

The building is scheduled to be finished this spring to support two offshore wind projects, Revolution Wind and South Fork Wind. (AP Photo/Jennifer McDermott)\nPROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) \u2014 U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said Thursday that the administration's goal for offshore wind and the projects being developed now represent a \u201cgust of job growth throughout the country.\u201d\nGranholm visited a new offshore wind manufacturing hub in Providence to talk about the Biden administration\u2019s plan to deploy 30 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030 and to promote the investments in the $1 trillion infrastructure deal. \n\u201cMore offshore wind means more jobs for iron workers, line workers, engineers, electricians, plumbers, pipefitters,\" she said. \u201cJobs in mining and manufacturing and management and operations and sales, not to mention of course the benefit to surrounding communities.\"\nAt the Port of Providence, Orsted, a Danish energy company, and the utility Eversource are constructing a building for the fabrication and assembly of large, advanced components for turbine foundations. Orsted officials gave Granholm and Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee a tour. The group met union workers who are building the facility. \nMcKee said he envisions Rhode Island as the \u201cbase camp\u201d to support the offshore wind supply chain along the East Coast. Granholm said looking at the building reminded her of a proverb: \u201cWhen the winds of change blow, some build walls, others build windmills.\u201d\n\u201cAnd we know which side of that Rhode Island falls on,\u201d she said.\nEversource President and CEO Joe Nolan said the Biden administration's support of offshore wind is a \u201cbreath of fresh air\u201d after the Trump administration. Both Nolan and Orsted Offshore North America CEO David Hardy said such support is critical while the U.S. industry is still in the fragile, early stages. \n\u201cThe momentum is happening,\u201d Nolan said. \u201cWe need it to continue.\u201d\n\u201cIt's a young industry,\u201d added Hardy. \u201cWe need help getting the first projects off the ground.\u201d\nTheir manufacturing hub at the port is scheduled to be finished this spring to support two offshore wind projects, Revolution Wind and South Fork Wind.\nRevolution Wind is a planned offshore wind farm south of Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Massachusetts, to provide power for Connecticut and Rhode Island. The federal government is currently reviewing the construction and operations plan. \nThe South Fork Wind project will be located off the coast of Rhode Island. Its transmission system will connect to the electric grid on Long Island, New York, making it the state\u2019s first offshore wind farm and jumpstarting the offshore wind industry there. \nGranholm announced last week that the administration approved the construction and operations for South Fork Wind, as part of a plan to deploy 30 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030. It was the administration's second approval of a commercial-scale, offshore wind energy project in the United States. The first commercial-scale project is off the coast of Massachusetts.\nThe first U.S. offshore wind farm began operating off Block Island, Rhode Island, in late 2016. But at five turbines, it\u2019s not commercial-scale. Orsted acquired the developer, Rhode Island-based Deepwater Wind, and now operates that wind farm.\nGranholm also visited a manufacturer of electric vehicle chargers and a clean energy technology company in Connecticut Thursday. On Friday, she's hosting a roundtable discussion in Boston about the transition to clean energy.\nGranholm has been making stops around the country to talk about how investments in infrastructure incentivize companies like these to open and expand, driving the transition away from fossil fuels, creating jobs and helping people save money on energy. She is visiting areas that are proactive in reducing emissions and areas where more work needs to be done.\nPresident Joe Biden signed his hard-fought $1 trillion infrastructure deal into law in November, declaring that the new infusion of cash for roads, bridges, ports and more is going to make life \u201cchange for the better\u201d for the American people. It has $100 million for wind energy research and development, $2.5 billion for transmission lines, including transmission from offshore wind farms, and $20 million to ensure offshore wind is built sustainably, Granholm said.\nThe companion piece of legislation, the social and environment bill under consideration in the Senate, has $600 million for port infrastructure, as well as significant tax credits to incentivize offshore wind development and turbine manufacturing, she added. 7 Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy For a Healthy Portfolio in 2022One year ago, investors expected 2021 to be a huge year for pharmaceutical stocks. The bullish perspective was that as vaccines rolled out and the economy reopened, investors would shift from biotech stocks to traditional pharmaceutical stocks.\n\nBut the Delta variant has kept Covid-19 top of mind for many investors. While it\u2019s true that some pharmaceutical stocks were part of the vaccine race, other players in the space have not performed as well as was hoped. Case in point, as of October 6, 2021, the iShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF (NYSEARCA:IHE) is up only 9.7% in the last 12 months. And if you bought shares of the fund at the beginning of the year, you have no growth to show for your patience.\n\nThere are reasons beyond Covid-19 to consider when assessing the disappointing performance of pharmaceutical stocks. One is the current political climate which is making no secret of its desire to reshape the healthcare industry. And it has the pricing practices of \u201cbig pharma\u201d firmly in its crosshairs.\n\nHowever, the pharmaceutical sector is still loaded with quality stocks for investors who are willing to accept the inherent risk. And that\u2019s the focus of this special presentation. In the next few minutes, we\u2019ll take a look at seven pharmaceutical stocks that\nare ready to make strong moves forward in 2022.View the \"7 Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy For a Healthy Portfolio in 2022\"."

(AP) \u2014 Kellogg's has reached a tentative agreement with its 1,400 cereal plant workers that will deliver 3% raises and end a nearly two-month-long strike if the deal is approved.\nThe five-year deal with the Bakery, Confectionary, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union also includes cost of living adjustments in the second through the fifth years of the contract and it maintains the workers' current health benefits, the company said Thursday. \nKellogg's workers who have been on strike since Oct. 5 will vote on the new contract Sunday. The company said it expects the results to be announced early next week.\nThe new deal covers workers at all four of Kellogg's U.S. cereal plants, which are located in Battle Creek, Michigan; Omaha, Nebraska; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; and Memphis, Tennessee. They make all of the company's well-known brands of cereal, including Frosted Flakes and Rice Krispies.\nThe tentative agreement also addresses the two-tiered system of wages that had been a sticking point for the union. The system gives newer workers less pay and fewer benefits and it includes up to 30% of the workforce at the plants. The Battle Creek-based company said the agreement will allow all workers with at least four years of experience to move up to the higher legacy pay level immediately and some additional workers would move up in the later years of the contract.\nUnion President Anthony Shelton thanked all the members of the bargaining committee in a statement but he said workers \u201cwill have the final say on the contract.\u201d\nOutside the Kellogg's plant in Omaha, Eric Dwornicki said it is encouraging to see that a tentative agreement was reached, but the details of the deal will determine whether it will pass.\n\u201cWe want to go back to work, but we don't want to be taken advantage of,\u201d said Dwornicki, 35, who has worked at the plant for nearly 10 years.\nDan Luers, who's father worked at the plant for 22 years, said at least the agreement is a sign of progress after nine weeks on strike. Luers, 32, has worked at the Omaha cereal plant for 10 years.\nJerry Ellerman celebrated the 17th anniversary of when he started at the plant and his 50th birthday on the picket line in Omaha, but he said the strike won't end unless it is a good deal.\n\u201cI'm willing to stay out here if it's not fair,\u201d Ellerman said.\nThe company took a hard line with workers during the strike.\nLast month, Kellogg's went to court in Omaha to secure an order that set guidelines for how workers behave on the picket line because the company said striking workers were blocking entrances to its cereal plant and intimidating replacement workers. Union officials denied any improper behavior.\nThe company has been using salaried employees and outside workers to keep its plants running during the strike, and it threatened last week to begin hiring permanent replacements for some striking workers.\nBut the union held out for higher wages after employees had been working long hours \u2014 more than 80 hours a week \u2014 over the past 18 months to keep up with demand during the coronavirus pandemic. And workers believed that the ongoing widespread worker shortages across the country gave them an advantage in the negotiations.\nIn another recent strike, more than 10,000 Deere workers secured 10% raises and improved benefits before returning to work last month.Should you invest $1,000 in Kellogg right now?Before you consider Kellogg, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

(AP Photo/Amr Nabil, File)\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 OPEC and allied oil-producing countries decided Thursday to stick to their plans to boost oil production even as the new omicron variant cast a shadow of uncertainty over the global economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.\nOfficials from OPEC countries, led by Saudi Arabia, and their allies, led by Russia, voted to deliver steady, modest monthly increases in oil releases \u2014 a pace that frustrated the United States and other oil-consuming nations as gasoline prices have risen. \nThe OPEC+ alliance approved an increase in production of 400,000 barrels per day for the month of January. \nThe fast-mutating variant led countries to impose travel restrictions when it emerged late last week. In a worst-case scenario, lockdowns triggered by omicron could cut oil demand by nearly 3 million barrels per day in early 2022, according to projections by Rystad Energy. \nPositive news about drugs to treat the variant or the vaccines' effectiveness against it could improve that outlook. But even with positive news, a decrease in oil demand is likely because \u201cthe distribution of these remedies may not actually reach all markets with extreme immediacy, which would still necessitate the lockdowns in much of the developing world,\u201d said Louise Dickson, senior oil markets analyst for Rystad.\nThe price of a barrel of U.S. benchmark crude fell with news of the variant. It was about $78 a barrel a week ago and was trading at about $67 a barrel Thursday. International benchmark Brent crude followed a similar path, falling from $79 a barrel a week ago to about $70 on Thursday.\nThe decision by OPEC+ to stay the course sends a signal that \u201cthe group does what it says and that they will continue their policy on their own terms,\u201d Dickson said. \u201cIt also really signals that OPEC+ needs a bit more time to really dig into the numbers on the omicron variant.\u201d\nSaudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman earlier this week played down any impact the little-understood variant would have on oil demand, telling the kingdom\u2019s Asharq al-Awsat newspaper: \u201cWe are not worried.\"\nBut OPEC ministers briefly postponed one of their meetings this week, hoping for more insight into whether the variant is likely to push the world back toward pandemic lockdowns or leave markets relatively unscathed.\nSome analysts had predicted that the OPEC+ alliance would act cautiously Thursday, pending more clarity from medical experts on the new variant.\nBefore omicron\u2019s appearance, the OPEC+ meeting had been shaping up as a potentially fraught moment in a growing dispute between oil-supplying nations and oil-consuming ones, as the global economy rebounds from the worst of the pandemic downturn and demand for oil surged.\nAngering the U.S. and its allies, OPEC+ has stuck to a plan to open the petroleum taps bit by bit \u2014 even as oil prices surged to seven-year highs \u2014 until deep production cuts made during the depths of the pandemic are restored.\nWith rising gas prices putting him under political pressure at home, President Joe Biden last week responded to OPEC\u2019s refusal to increase supplies more quickly by announcing the U.S. and other nations would release tens of millions of barrels of oil from their strategic reserves, boosting supplies and temporarily lowering prices. But gasoline prices in the U.S. barely moved.\nAnd then, omicron\u2019s emergence unsettled those dynamics. \nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday that there are no plans to slow releases from strategic reserves, despite the advent of the variant and OPEC's decision. \n\"We welcome the decision today to continue the 400,000 barrels-per-day increase,\u201d Psaki said. \u201cTogether with our coordinated release from the SPR, we believe this should help facilitate the global economic recovery.\u201d \nBiden sent senior energy adviser Amos Hochstein to the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia this week to soothe relations, address energy prices and talk about working together in transitioning to cleaner energy. Hochstein met with the Saudi energy minister Tuesday.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unclear whether the U.S. will become more active, using its SPR to control prices,\u201d said Paul Sheldon, chief geopolitical advisor at S&P Global Platts. \"But the precedent has been set, and it will probably at least become a factor within OPEC decision making in the future.\"\nOPEC+ will meet again Jan. 4.\n___\nKnickmeyer reported from Washington.

And with good reason. Fintech (short for financial technology) is not just \u201cdigital banking.\u201d It\u2019s a different approach to banking that traditional banks will not be able to replicate by outspending their competitors.\n\nYou see, cryptocurrency is getting a lot of attention for the way it\u2019s disrupting the monetary system. But before there was bitcoin (CCC: BTC-USD), there was fintech.\n\nWhat started out as a way to send money from one person to another without the need for a bank (i.e. peer-to-peer lending) has morphed into much more. Today, individuals and businesses can get loans, invest, and pay bills conveniently and securely. And they can do so without ever having to set foot into a bank.\n\nFinancial technology is democratizing finance for many individuals who have been left behind by the traditional banking system. The \u201cunbanked\u201d is a huge target audience. But whereas fintech started as reaching those that were unbanked out of necessity; it is cultivating a new audience among those who are going unbanked by choice.\n\nIn this special presentation, we\u2019ll look at seven fintech companies that are leading in this space today and will do so well into the future.\nView the \"7 Fintech Stocks That Will Continue To Disrupt Traditional Banking\"."
